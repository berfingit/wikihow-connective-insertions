Calculate_Atomic_Mass.txt	Intro	The mass of an electron is so small , it is considered negligible and not included in the calculation .	Intro	However , the mass of an electron is so small , it is considered negligible and not included in the calculation .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><The><1><the><3>	Atomic mass is the sum of all the protons, neutrons, and electrons in a single atom or molecule.	Though technically incorrect, the term is also often used to refer to the average atomic mass of all of the isotopes of one element. This second definition is actually the relative atomic mass, also known as the atomic weight, of an element. The atomic weight takes into account the average of the masses of naturally occurring isotopes of the same element. Chemists need to distinguish between these two types of atomic mass to guide their work - an incorrect value for atomic mass can, for instance, lead to an incorrect calculation of an experiment's yield.

It is really definitely a good idea to find out Her answer before you ask her. Whether she's actually told you she'd like to go with you, (which sure makes things easier) or you tell your friend to ask his friend to ask her friend to ask her sister to ask her, or you even 'hypothetically' ask her yourself. Make sure you are sure of what she will say! Think of the asking as merely letting her know that you'd like to go with her. This way, you'll be saved immense trouble - not to mention embarrassment - if she would've said no, or you can go all the way if she'd love to go with you. 2. PLAN what you are going to do. Where? When? How? Who? Remember: go with romance and classiness over corniness and puns; simple, creative, or cute is not always what to go for. Try not to be daring; go with something you know she'll like. Be sincere, not amazing. Sincerity is the key. If she knows you care, it'll make it all that much better. Be sweet, not cute. Get her a rose, not a bear. A single chocolate bar is better than a dozen with corny sayings. That just makes it awkward.	.

Identify your emotions carefully and specifically. Before you can work through negative emotions, you need to identify them. Imagine you’re writing a report on your emotions and you need to be as detailed as possible. You shouldn’t only think about type of emotion, but the intensity of that emotion, too. * ”Upset” is a pretty vague way to describe your emotional state. Dig deeper to find a more specific identifier, like “deeply disappointed.” * Rather than saying you feel “good,” you could describe yourself as “ecstatic” or “relaxed.” 2. Observe your emotions without judging yourself. If you’re feeling angry at your partner, let yourself feel angry. Don’t try to suppress your emotions, or beat yourself up for feeling a certain way. You’re only human! Instead, let yourself sit with the thoughts and sensations that come with the emotion. * Notice the strange physical sensations that accompany the emotion, like the tightening of your chest or the rapid beating of your heart. * You might think, “Ok, I’m feeling angry at John because he forgot to call when he arrived at the hotel. It’s ok to feel angry--it doesn’t mean I’m being a crazy girlfriend.” 3. Figure out why you’re feeling upset. Once you’ve identified and observed your emotions, it’s time for a little detective work.	Are you mad because you feel disrespected by your partner, or does your anger have more to do with a rough day at work?

Apply black or brown eyeliner on the inner rims of your eyes - top and bottom.	Next apply a light brown eyeshadow. You can put a bronze color over top of this for a little fancier look. Finally, use the concealer on any red spots or zits.

Select your work area: - Table, Flat Desk or Secluded Flat area waist high. Ensure your area is large enough to facilitate the total number of pieces laid out individually face up. 2. Empty Box Contents onto Work Area. 1. Turn all pieces face up and at the same time, 2. Select Edge Pieces and put them to one side. This gives you an invaluable starting point for your progress. Note: - For Shaped jigsaws this may be a difficult task (i.e. determining edge pieces). 3. Arrange pieces into color groups. This step is determined by the design and complexity of the puzzle. As you progress through the arranging of the pieces face up and edge, arrange all pieces into colour groups. Eg. Blue/green water, green grass, blue/grey sky, reds and yellows, etc. (Also parts of buildings, statues, fences, etc.) * You can also try sorting by tabs and blanks, especially if completing a traditional jigsaw puzzle. Tabs are the parts of the piece that jut out, and blanks are the parts of the piece that jut in. 4. Try to complete colour group sections of the puzzle. At this point continue to refer to the finished picture (usually on the front of the box). Eg. Houses, fences, etc. 5. Assemble the Edge pieces on your workbench. 6. Place any grouped colour sections into the inner area of the puzzle where it seems obvious to be placed guided by the finished picture. 7. Commence placing the balance of the pieces into your puzzle. This is best achieved by expanding the already compiled colour or edge sections. 8. As you progress with the compilation of the puzzle you will get to the stage whereby you can see the end of the project. 9. Continue on until you complete the puzzle. 10. Determine your aim for the jigsaw. 1. Save for another person. * Carefully breakdown the puzzle and return pieces into plastic bag then back into box. 2. Keep and Store/Display. * Paint the Surface of the Puzzle with Puzzle Conserver. This stops the Jigsaw from fading over time. Determine the storage space for your puzzle and ensure it is safe from pending damage. Done carefully this also allows you to slide the puzzle around your work area in 1 piece. Alternatively you can store it in a Jigsaw Holder. 3. Finish with Framing and Display arrangement. * Select your ‘backing board’ (Refer to Sizes below). Determine the background colour for your finished article. (2 or 3mm STD MDF Panel Board is perfect). The lighter the board, the easier it is to carry when finished, especially if the jigsaw is large. 4. Determine the background colour for your puzzle. (Sample shown) 11. Ensure the backing board is large enough for your finished puzzle. (Refer example shown). 1. Place the jigsaw onto the board and frame with board cuttings positioned so as to allow for framing area. (Refer sample shown). Remove the Board cuttings. 2. Mark the perimeter of the jigsaw on the board with a pencil. Slide the Jigsaw onto a spare board and re-install the board cuttings. 3. Slide the Jigsaw puzzle into its designated final position. 4. Place side 2 of your sandwich board into place and clamp together. 5. Carefully turn the sandwich over and move to a temporary storage area. 6.	You can now paint the outer perimeter of the board (Around the jigsaw area). Note: - At this point it is best you remark jigsaw area as per point (5) above after the paint is dry.

Start on a small scale with simple scenes, large pieces, and minimal number of pieces. For example, a 50–300 piece rectangular puzzle allows you to experiment with different methods for assembling your puzzle in a short amount of time. Graduate to a larger number of pieces (such as a puzzle with 300 – 1000 pieces, or even larger) once you’re confident assembling puzzles with the method you’ve chosen. Also look for other challenges, like 3D puzzles, puzzles with only one color, multi-layered puzzles, and infinity puzzles. 2. Set up your work area. Pick a hard, flat surface like a table for your work area. Ensure your area is large enough to accommodate the total number of pieces. Empty the contents of the box onto the work area. Turn all of the pieces face up. 3. Sort the pieces. Pull out all of the edge pieces. Consider sorting the pieces by color and keeping the color groups in separate piles on your work area. Put all of the pieces with writing on them in a different pile.	When you’re assembling the puzzle, it will eventually be obvious where these specially shaped pieces belong.

There's nothing badass about needing to ask everyone for help. This will obviously depend a lot on where you are and what you do, but it's important to try to be as capable and single-minded as possible.

Take pride in accomplishing things with your own work put into it.

Wicca is a religion that embraces magick, and promotes nature. Magick the focus of intent, aided by sympathetic powers, such as herbs, spirits, symbols, and other tools, in order to bring about a fated change specified by the conjurer. Conjury (sorcery) isn't all there is to practicing 'Witchcraft'(Wicca), as wisdom seeking and jumping the hedge are all very important, and crucial, elements of Wicca. Wicca is a pagan-based religion, and isn't all that there is to 'Witchcraft'. It is important to differentiate from a 'Witch' and a 'witch'. Incorrectly, Wiccans take the title of a witch, as do other Pagan religions. A 'Witch', or more correctly, Wiccan, is a practioner of the religion of Wicca. A 'witch' is a different species closely related to humans, who can change the very fabric of reality to their will. Wiccans believe that one should not harm others, or do anything akin to manipulation. Such as love spells, which most Wiccans and Pagans believe to be a wrong use of magick.	.

They are available from grocery stores, food distributors and farmers markets, during the growing season.	They are uncooked and ready to be boiled after being re-hydrated. Roasted peanuts have already been cooked and should not be boiled (BoiledPeanutPro.com). Boiling green peanuts is a tradition in the rural southeastern US where peanuts are grown both in small gardens and large farms. They are also enjoyed in India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Indonesia, China, Australia, and Vietnam. There are many variations, depending on the seasoning used, but the basic method is the same for all of them, and the process of boiling makes the peanuts healthier for you, since boiled peanuts have more polyphenol antioxidants than roasted ones. Here are the steps for this fun project.

The last thing your friend needs is their best friend dozing off on their shoulder while they're looking for reassurance about their boyfriend or girlfriend or anything else. You need to be alert and bright eyed to deal with whatever situation is at hand. 2. Pay attention to every word and try to relate to what they are saying and be understanding of the situation. If you don't pay attention, you'll rip your friendship to shreds. People love to be listened to and made time for. It makes them feel special. 3. Arrange a monthly date that you'll never be busy on. Use that time to hang out with your mates and to catch up. If you've got friends from old schools that you haven't seen in a while, call them to chat. They'll like the fact that you haven't forgotten them. Try to meet up so you can do things and go out to have fun. 4. Don't let boyfriends or girlfriends get in the way. Loads of people tell me that since their friends new boyfriend or girlfriend came along, nothings been the same. Take the time to have time between just you and your mates. It will strengthen your friendship. Remember: They stood by you every step of the way. 5. Get them special presents just before or after you go on holidays or breaks. It'll give them something to remind them of you or make them feel remembered when you get back. . 6. When they get new friends, try not to feel jealous and try to make their new friends be comfortable around you.

Apply_1920s_Makeup.txt	## Steps	Draw your lower lip as slightly plumper than it really is by extending slightly on the bottom .	### Adding Final Touches	Then draw your lower lip as slightly plumper than it really is by extending slightly on the bottom .	<insert><Then><1>|||<replace><Draw><1><draw><2>	Steps  1. Find and apply a foundation in your skin tone that will give your complexion a creamy, perfect look. You may have to use an older variety, such as pancake, or a cream meant more for theater than for everyday use. To allow your skin to breathe, thin down cream foundation by moistening your sponge before dipping in the base. If your skin is naturally porcelain or alabaster-toned, play it up. 2. Darken and turn your eyebrows slightly downwards with an eyebrow pencil or even eyeliner that is darker than your actual brow color. Thin eyebrows were fashionable in the 20s, so this step works most accurately if your brows are already on the thin side. If not, you don't have to start tweezing away--you can cover your brows with a 1920s-style hat or with bangs chopped straight across as part of a bob cut. 3. Smooth on your usual eye makeup primer before applying a dark eyeshadow from lash line to crease. Pick a gray-based shadow to keep your eyes on the sooty side, which is what you're aiming for. Use a black kohl eyeliner on both top and bottom lash lines. Don't scrimp--you want all the dark tones to meld together. Color top and bottom lashes with blackest black mascara. You want them dark so as to appear like you used paint to blacken them. You may want to use a waterproof formulation for all of your eye makeup to avoid unwanted smudging as much as possible. 4. Find a cheek stain or cream blush with touches of red in it. You are going for a rouged look; if red is too strong for your coloring, raspberry or rose are alternatives. Rub blush into apples of cheeks. Blend away hard edges, but make sure the color is still evident, as though you just walked in from the cold. 5. Apply pale pancake foundation over clean and exfoliated lips. With a waxy dark red lip liner, create a 1920s mouth by exaggerating the cupid's bow on your top lip.	Draw both upper and bottom lips as shorter on the sides. Fill new lip shape in with pencil before layering matching lipstick over it. When you are through, your lips should not be as wide as they really are, giving the illusion that you have them puckered and ready for a kiss.

Go online and look for some online stores that sell bathing suits. It can be really helpful to see what styles are out there, and what you'd like to wear yourself. 2. Go out to a store on your own. Buying a bathing suit can be really nerve-wracking with people who you know firing out comments, and have a look around by yourself first. 3. Try a tankini. The easiest bathing suit to get used to is the tankini. There are lots of variations - simple black tanks, halter necks with embellishments and such. Don't be afraid of trying on different things that may or may not look great on you - there's no one there to judge you! 4. After you've determined a few of your favourites, come back with a close friend or family member you trust, and ask for their opinion. The main thing, however, is that you like it and feel good in it. 5. Pick the one you like best, and purchase at the counter! (You can also purchase a pair of board shorts if you want your legs to be covered more.) 6. If you're not comfortable in any of these things, you can even wear gym shorts with a whitebeater. It's just another option. 7. To look more tomboyish, wear waterproof/board shorts over a bathing suit. Make sure to wear something under because if you are doing watersports or diving they could come off. Make sure they fit. 8.	.
Calm_an_Aggressive_Cat.txt	### Changing Aggressive Behavior	Give it a treat for its good behavior .	### Changing Aggressive Behavior	Then give it a treat for its good behavior .	<insert><Then><1>|||<replace><Give><1><give><2>	Changing Aggressive Behavior  1. Start your intervention early. If a cat is displaying aggressive behavior early in life you should try to change it quickly. Eliminating aggressive behavior in a young cat or kitten can prevent it from becoming habit. * Even if a cat is older it is still worth your time to try and reduce its aggression. The cat will simply take more time to change its behavior than than a young cat would. 2. Figure out what is causing the aggression. In order to minimize the cat's aggression you need to get to its root cause. Start by thinking about what has changed in the animal's life that may be giving it anxiety. Also be on the lookout for what happens to and around the cat right before an episode. If you can figure out where the aggression is coming from, you may be able to mitigate it. Some common reasons for aggression to begin include: * Fear * Defensiveness * Conflict with other animals * Redirected anger * Territorial feelings * Predatory aggression * Overstimulation * Rough play excitement * Maternal protection * General irritability * Pain * Thyroid issues * Lack of attention * Change in location * A past trauma 3. Identify the signs that your cat is about to become aggressive. There are typically some warning signs that your cat is going to become aggressive before it strikes out. By identifying them and stopping the stimulus that is causing the behavior, you can sometimes avoid the incident altogether. While each cat's behavior before an aggressive episode can differ, some common signs include: * Crouching or squatting * Tucking the head down * Wide eyes with dilated pupils * Retracted whiskers * Hissing or spitting * Putting its hackles up * Ears flattened back 4. Make adjustments that will ease your cat's aggression. If you have figured out that your cat's aggression has a specific cause, make any possible adjustments that will eliminate the cause. There are some issues that can be eliminated by making changes to the cat's living situation or interactions. For example, if your cat gets aggressive when you play roughly with it, stop that kind of play. * If your cat has a hard time with other animals, it might be best to keep it as an only pet. 5. Reward good behavior. As you are trying to change your cat's behavior, it is important to let the animal know when it is doing a good job. Rewarding the cat with treats or a game it likes to play when it is acting nicely is a good way of showing it the right kind of behavior. * For example, if your cat gets aggressive when petted for too long, reward it when it doesn't exhibit this behavior. Pet it lightly for a few moments in your lap and before the interaction goes awry set it on the floor.	If your repeat this process, the cat will learn that it gets something it likes if it does not strike out in anger.

Buy your wood from a reputable manufacturer who has kiln-dried and stored it in climate controlled conditions before shipping it to you. The best manufacturers make sure their hardwood has been acclimatized to an environment of 45 percent humidity, which is the median for the U.S. and Canada. Avoid sources that are vague about how they acquire, prepare and ship their wood. 2. Open the ends of the packages, but don't remove the planks. While air needs to circulate around the hardwood in order for it to adjust its moisture content, removing the planks will allow them to warp and change shape. If your project involves fitting the planks together, you may find it impossible to do. 3. The previous is old trade craft. Depending upon the environment and wood species, the boards on the ends of the carton will swell or shrink faster than those in the middle of the carton. Opening the ends of the box usually results in calling the retailer / manufacturer and saying the flooring is mis-milled. This will also delay your installation. 4. Stack the packages so air can circulate around them. Place bricks, sticks or pieces of scrap wood between the packages or stack them in a staggered fashion. Be careful that you provide support every foot or so under the packages so they don't bow in the middle. 5. Let the hardwood sit for at about 2 weeks, longer if the environment is considerably more or less humid than 45 percent. You can buy a wood moisture tester to check the water content of the wood and see if it falls in the correct range for your area. Don't begin your project until the wood is ready. 6. Acclimation is a process not a matter of days or weeks. You are trying to acclimate the material to normal living conditions. You should factor in the room temperature, relative humidity, the moisture content of the flooring and the subfloor. In addition to a moisture meter you need a hydrometer to tell you the relative humidity (RH) at your installation. 7. Complete your hardwood project during a season when the humidity is not too high or too low. Fall and spring are generally better times than winter and summer, unless frequent rains are common. 8.	.

Acacia posted nudes when she was 13 years old .	<insert><also><1>|||<insert><,><1>	Steps  1. Makeup: Acacia does her make up a lot: Try not to over-do it. Acacia has done a couple make up tutorials on Youtube, which is really inspiring. She mentioned in a couple of her video's that she doesnt really use lipgloss, so to keep your lips protected, though personalized as Acacia, use some lip balm, like cocoa-butter lip balm, or try out Baby Lips, which is stylish, and what teen girl doesnt love Baby Lips? Add just an amount of eye-shadow, her eye lids usually look a little plain, though she adds some there! Also, add some mascara to spice up your look. Try not too hard to make your eye lashes look too long, but to keep it standing out, curl it just once in a while. Use just a small amount of a pinkish blush to keep your cheeks perfect, and outstanding. 2. Hair: Acacia usually dies her hair every once in a while, so try some natural hair color's that you'd think look good on you! If you have tanish skin, you could strut it out with some black, brown, maroon, or maybe blonde hair! If your pale, black, brown, and blonde hair would look good on you as well! If your dark skinned, then try something like maroon, brown, or black hair with a touch of golden honey. Acacia also sometimes leaves her hair straight using an Instyler. Sometimes when Acacia feels its the right moment to do this, she like adding some bouncy curls, that go with her hair. 3. Personality: As you see in her videos on YouTube, Acacia shows a lot of appreciation and dedication to her fans and followers on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and so forth. She makes a lot of cute though awkward moments on Youtube, and she's really funny at the seams. She does things like summer favorites, and she takes the time to make vlogs for her 'kitties' as in her fans. Acacia is also serious at the time, like her 'Words Hurt' video. She also let's us know how she's doing most of the time, and she loves her friends. 4. Style: Acacia usually wears shorts, and crop tops for a summer look. On Winter days, she'd wears skinnies, oversized sweaters, and uggs. Sometimes she'd even add some cute little things like panda mittens to increase her style. On a casual day, she'd wear a cute normal shirt, with jeans, and branned shoes. 5. Taking Selifes: Acacia, being the girl teen that she is, takes a lot of selfies, no matter where she is! On Instagram, use the 'Valencia'filter, which she mentioned on one of her YouTube videos. Take selfies no matter how random, funny, weird, or cocky they look! 6. Acacia doesnt brag, though she mentions how she got so many followers on any of her accounts. Look at her YouTube channel: 'Acacia Cutie' and you'd get an image on how to be an amazing Acacia! 7. Also: 8.	It's fine if you want to be like her, but don't do this!

Buy_Raw_Land.txt	### Locating Your Ideal Property	If you are planning on farming in any way beyond a simple home garden , you need to make sure your land is zoned for agricultural development .	### Locating Your Ideal Property	In addition , if you are planning on farming in any way beyond a simple home garden , you need to make sure your land is zoned for agricultural development .	<insert><In><1>|||<insert><addition><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><4>	Locating Your Ideal Property  1. Ensure there's access to sewage and water. Two things that make land essentially useless are a lack of a septic system and/or a water source. These are the most important things to consider when investigating properties. * Sewer systems are an important consideration. Off-the-grid land sometimes cannot be connected to a municipal sewer system, so when making purchasing decisions plan for a septic system. Make sure your property is not only zoned for septic, but has the space to install a septic system far enough away to avoid water contamination. * Does your land have access to water? Trucking water is expensive and collecting rainwater is inefficient in most places. Make sure you have access and rights to water and, if you plan on digging a well, factor that into your decision as this can become quite expensive. 2. Consider roads and topography. The soil system of your land, and how and if you can reach it by road, also determine its worth. Take topography and transportation seriously in the searching process. * Does your property have access to a road? If not, you should be willing and able to build one as inaccessible land is also essentially worthless. What is the climate like? If you're buying in an area with cold, snowy winters considering the type of road, if any, leading to your land is particularly important. * Consider electricity. If your property is far off the grid how do you plan on getting electricity to your location? You can pay the power company to string a poll in your direction, which can be expensive, or use alternative sources like wind or solar. * What is the topography of your land? Take notice of where water runs, if your land can support infrastructure. Watch for signs of flooding and know soil types and grade. Knowing your soil type also affects your ability to drill and set up a water source like a well, so make sure you factor in the added cost of drilling through something like rock as opposed to a softer soil like sand. 3. Know your rights, and be aware of environmental restrictions. Oftentimes, legal jargon and existing restrictions are difficult to comprehend. Unfortunately, certain restrictions based on zoning and environment can greatly impact the worth of your land and how you can use it. * Secure your rights. There are various rights that go into the purchase of raw land. For example, do you have the right to anything found on the land, such as land oil, natural gas, gold, or other valuable materials? Make sure to look into this ahead of time to save yourself a long, legal battle and possible loss of potential fortune. Also, consider hunting. Owning property, in some areas, gives you a right to refuse hunting on that land. Look into this ahead of time, and consider your own comfort and concerns on the issue of game hunting. * How is your land zoned? How and if the land is zoned affects your ability to build a home on your land. Check the land's zoning very closely before signing any paperwork, paying especially close attention to whether the land was previously zoned for anything that may depreciate its value over time. Industrial farming, for example, leaves chemical residues that sinks a land's value. * Check any existing environmental restrictions, especially if you are buying very rural land. Waterfronts and wetlands especially have a variety of strict guidelines about use and building, which are limiting for owner's plans.	.

Place a small bowl or cup inside a bigger one. With a few household items, it's easy to see the principals of buoyancy in action! In this simple experiment, we'll demonstrate that a submerged object experiences buoyancy because it displaces a volume of fluid equal to the volume of the object submerged. To begin, place a small open container, like a bowl or a cup, inside a larger container, like large bowl or a bucket. 2. Fill the inner container to the brim. Next, fill the small inner container with water. You want the water level to be at the very top of the container without spilling. Be careful here! If you spill any water, empty the larger container before trying again. * If you have an eyedropper handy, this can be very helpful for precisely leveling off the water in the inner container. 3. Slowly lower an object into the inner container. Next, find a small object that can fit inside the inner container and won't be damaged by water.	You should notice some of the water in the inner container spill over the edge into the outer container.

Get a costume!! Pick a color that looks good on you: blue, pink, green, orange, purple,yellow, etc. If you want, find ones that have flowers or leaves on them. Those are typically called “nymph” costumes, and you can find ones for each season. Most costume stores have wings. Claire’s store in the mall has some smaller ones, but just as cute. * If you decide to make your own costume find patterns at a craft store, or Wal-Mart, and then buy the fabric. Usually the fabric you’ll use can be velvet, tulle, sheer, iridescent, etc. You can probably find used dresses and skirts at thrift shops which can be altered and decorated to your liking. * To make a fairy skirt, you can simply take ribbon or an elastic band (the size of your waist or hips, depending on where you wear it), and then take pieces of tulle or mesh fabric (the length depends on how tall you are), and tie them to the ribbon or elastic. Do enough of it so that when you wear it, it's not see-through. (But please do wear shorts underneath, we can't take any chances.) With the ribbon you can simply tie it, with the elastic you’ll need a way to fasten the back, either with Velcro, or a snap button. You could make large petals out of felt or fabric and attach them before, or after, you tie the tulle. Whatever works for you. * As for a top, you can create one if you’re good at sewing, or find a renaissance style shirt (which can be dyed if need be), or a top that's airy and isn't too heavy. Wands can be bought, or made. You can make wands using wooden dowels with foam stars, Styrofoam balls covered in fake flowers, with ribbon, and whatever else you can find. Use your imagination! * If you want a “crown”, that's simple! Take a headband and glue a fake butterfly, and/or some fake flowers to it. Or, take a few hairpins, or bobby pins, and glue it to that. Put them throughout your hair. Pretty! 2. For makeup, use glitter. Glitter makeup of any kind will work. Plus lots of bright colors (unless you want to be a dark fairy, then go with purples and blacks) Paint your nails, use blush and eyeshadow, face paint, etc! Whatever you want, will work just fine. 3. Try to be in the right environment. Well you can't be a real fairy, if you’re not anywhere near where a fairy should be. Woods, streams, and a backyard full of flowers and hiding places will do. Or you can create your own fairy garden. * You can't fly, but you can sure as heck feel mystical and magical. And in your costume, (and in your mind) you can feel a part of something you never knew before. When you believe you are a fairy, and you sit outside and you create your own magical world, you’ll know when you feel something strange. It's that chill up your spine. That feeling that something is watching you. And the tiny hints of laughter, that dance among the wind. Only then, can you truly be in a fairy environment. 4. Get the right scent. Part of being a fairy is having your own fairy smell. Now sure, you can buy any ‘ole perfume, or you can make your own. You can buy a perfume kit, which include different smells that you can mix and match to create one as unique as you are. You can also buy natural oils, which come in most health food stores, and add them to some water, in a spray bottle. Add a little fine glitter in it for some sparkle. Most fairy smells include flowers, fruits, chocolate, rain, cotton, etc. Depending on the type of fairy you are, create a perfume to match. 5. Pick your Talent. You’ll notice that the fairies in the Disney series, all have talents. Animal, Water, Garden, Earth, etc. Whats yours? To determine this you need to pick one that you love most. Do you love animals? Then you have an animal talent. Do you love flowers? Then you have garden talent. Knowing your talent will help you determine the smell of your perfume, the color and accents on your costume, and in your make-up, and how to set up your garden. For instance.	.

Be_a_Good_Director.txt	## Steps	Before each scene , tell the actors what you want to see them do .	## Steps	For example , before each scene , tell the actors what you want to see them do .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Before><1><before><4>	Steps  1. Decide on what play you want to produce. As a director, you try to find a play that is best suited to convey what you want to say to the audience. It is important that the play reflects how you feel about certain issues, either social, moral or ethical, and that the audience understands what you are trying to say. Once you've found a play or have written one yourself, it is time to gather a cast. 2. Run auditions. You are now at the point where you have to choose who will be on your cast. This can be a difficult choice, either because you have too few good actors or too many. In case of the former, you will have to spend a lot of rehearsal time improving their acting; in case of the latter, you simply have a luxury problem with the downside that some of the actors may sulk a bit because they wanted a bigger part and could have handled one well. At moments like that, it would be a good idea to remind those who are sulking that they are good actors but that your word is final. This is a direct mode of address and can be considered as rather rude, but when carried off gracefully you can earn the respect of your actors by being honest. When you hold auditions, be sure to keep a weather eye open for chemistry between certain actors. You can benefit from casting them in roles that require them to be on stage together a lot both physically and verbally. 3. Organize rehearsals. Once you finally start rehearsing, it is important to first explain your rules and how you work to your cast. Some of them may have only had one director prior to working with you and are used to a certain modus operandi. Be clear from the start that you have a certain method by which you work and that there are certain rules. Preferably, those rules are simple. For example: the actors are not allowed to speak during concentration exercises. Though this may seem obvious, it may sometimes happen that you have an excitable group to work with. For such a group, keeping a tight ship could be beneficial. It also shows that you take your part in the production seriously, which gains you some extra respect. * If you are working with inexperienced actors, organising other activities such as a rehearsal camp or some evenings out together could be very beneficial to both you and the cast. You get to know them a little better and, engaging in pleasant conversation, they find out that you're not the boggart they may have believed you were. It also allows your actors to get to know each other in an environment that doesn't involve them being focused. * Make sure your production manager is present at most, if not all, rehearsals. They need to know about the props you need in a timely fashion so they can arrange for them to be there when your production is ready to hit the theatres. * At the beginning of each rehearsal, have your actors do some concentration exercises. It will get them focused on the work that lies ahead of them. next to concentration exercises, vocal and physical exercises are also very useful as a warm-up. *	This will prevent an endless quest through various different approaches while you are trying to figure out which one you prefer.

Let go of your ego. A real hero knows that their actions might go unnoticed and that’s okay. Make sure you are trying to be a hero for the right reasons.

You’ll have to be focused more on the feeling you get from doing the good deed than the praise. center * Find the joy in seeing the smiles on other people’s faces. * Think about how you would feel having a good deed done for you. That will help you connect to the joy or change you’ve created in another person’s life. 2. Be the change you want to see. A true hero isn’t all talk. They are constantly thinking about how they can take action and help. You may be inspired to be a hero for a certain cause or issue, or you may try to be a hero to someone in need. center * For example, if you are passionate about the environment, don’t just preach to people that they should recycle. Try to start an environmental club at your school or get your friends together to help you build a compost bin in your backyard. * Maybe you are passionate about helping the homeless in your area. Rather than giving one homeless person money, you may get involved at your local homeless shelter and hand out food and basic supplies to the homeless in your area instead. 3. Put others before yourself. Think about what other people might need before you consider your own needs. When you are making decisions at work or at home, take some time to think about how your actions will affect someone else.	center

Stay educated. Being educated not only gives you the skills and knowledge you will need to pursue your career, it also makes you more well-respected by the people you encounter in your life. Your level of education (whether formal or informal) reflects your intelligence and shows others that you care about things other than your own personal life.center * Remember that not all education has to be formal (i.e. attained through an institution like a university). Keep up with current events in politics, science and technology, read books (both fiction and non-fiction), learn another language, watch documentaries, and so on. 2. Stand up for yourself. Whether you are a man or a woman, you will have to learn to fend for yourself in the real world if you want to avoid being taken advantage of. You must learn how to stand up for yourself at school, at work, and in your social life.center * If you hear somebody making a sexist, racist, or otherwise disrespectful comment, don't let it slide. This doesn't necessarily mean engaging in an argument; calmly tell the person that what he or she said is not appreciated. * Let people know when they have wronged you. If somebody betrays you in any way, be sure to let him or her know. This will prevent the person from repeating the behavior in the future. 3. Take care of your body. Personal strength is manifested physically, mentally, and emotionally. If you want to be a strong, independent woman, you need look no further than your own body.center * Exercise for 1 hour every single day.

Underarm, leg and facial hair is especially taboo. It is considered unattractive. But why should we fall for such ridiculous notions and condition ourselves to think that body hair is repulsive?	This also counts for body hair. Why have other people make us feel ashamed about something that belongs to our healthy, natural body? Also, having body hair is a sign of an adult body, i.e. sexual development. Removing body hair is a waste of time and money. There are more important and productive things to invest your time and money in. Besides, men don't remove their body hair and no one thinks twice of a man who is hairy. Be proud that you are a woman (i.e., you have hair) as opposed to a sexually immature girl (who doesn't, naturally) and question this widespread ideal. Why would anyone find hairless females (i.e. little girls) sexually attractive? The time has come to embrace our natural beauty! Shun those razors, resist the hair-removal propagandists who are only interested in your money and ignore the dullard lemming majority!

Looks count. It's all about how you present yourself, and if you want to present yourself in a good way then put some effort into your appearance. You don't have to be a rich supermodel to do this, luckily! 2. Have good hygiene. The basic steps are showering at least once a day using a moisturizing soap for softer and smoother skin. 3. Be sure to brush your teeth it's a must to do. Brush them 2-3 times a day with whitening paste to keep them white, and healthy and follow up with flossing, and mouthwash. Then, after meals, pop in some gum. Use Orbitz whitening gum, and/or Trident White. If you have stained teeth consider Crest WhiteStripes Premium Plus. They're the cheapest and the results are great. You have plenty more options when bleaching your teeth like using trays (which they're more expensive), and/or going to a professional, which is even more expensive. But the results are worth it. After bleaching your teeth, you must sacrifice a few things to keep them pearly white. Your enamel is removed so your teeth are brighter, but it's more prone to stains. Sacrifice colorful pastes, and trade in for some white paste for an entire week. Eat white foods like rice, milk, and chicken, use clear alcohol-free mouthwash, and to maintain color, chew some whitening gum after every meal. And if you have crooked teeth, consider getting some retainers. A smile is a welcoming, yet simple way to attract people to you. 4. Take care of your skin. Perfect skin doesn't come easy for everyone, of course. Even if you have a huge pimple that you can't get rid of, you should still walk tall. But to cure them, and prevent any more just stick with a product you're using or invest in acne products that include benzoyl peroxide, and/or salicylic acid. Buy products that would benefit your skin needs. First find out your skin type. Most product ingredients are especially formulated for your skin type. They're normally labeled on the product. Doing this you can easily manage your skin needs, and find products that may help your skin. Though not every product work for every person. The only way to find out what works best for your skin is if you experiment with products. You could also go to a dermatologist to prescribe some quality treatments for your specific problem in skin. If you don't see improvement in your skin in a few days with your new product it doesn't mean it's not working. It takes at least a month minimum to see improvement. If skin is irritated, red, or damaged after a day or a week of use with the product stop use immediately. Follow labeled directions for a successful wash. The best way to get clear skin is a healthy diet which includes plenty fruits, vegetables, and 8 ounces of water a day, and 9 hours of sleep. Doing so it improves, and hydrates skin. Also look for good facial treatments for your skin. Search special facials like banana and honey, egg white, strawberries, and plenty more. Do your facials with your friends monthly. They'll thank you. Clear skin is a definite boost in confidence level, not only your face would glow, your personality would shine too! 5. Pluck your brows. Pluck away only stray hairs very other week. Plucking your brows everyday can irritate your skin. It's easy to lose shape when trying to pluck "only" stray hairs. You can be left browless, being tweezer happy. If it ever happens apply olive oil to help speed growth of brows. While brows grow back ask professions to pencil some for you. If you can't afford, or take time to go to the salon do them yourself with a brow pencil. Make sure the color is a bit lighter than your natural hair color, and apply in light, feather-like strokes. To define your brows, use a light brown eyeshadow, a small short bristle eye brush, and some eyebrow gel. Next choose your eyeshadow color. If you have light hair, use a light beige shade, for dark hair use a darker beige. But never use black! Trust me, it will look very artificial, and harsh. After you found your shade fill in the brow with the short bristled eye brush in light strokes. Last set brows with eyebrow gel working the product from the inside of the brow into the outside. Your brows will look perfect! A good simple trick to define brows is to apply white eyeliner below your eyebrow, and blend in. If don't like makeup, know your limits, and use a small eyebrow comb, and brush brows up, and lastly use a small amount of Vaseline to set brows, and tame them. 6. Get the right makeup. Always ask questions to yourself about the products you are buying. If you're buying foundation, ask yourself "does the shade match my skin tone?" and "Does this product benefits me?" The two-toned look is'nt pretty. Consult a professional for help. 7. Keep it simple. A little color never hurts. But no matter what, never rush when you're applying your makeup. Take some time to work on each feature. This is a basic rule when you're working on perfecting makeup. * Skin should be clean and moisturized before you put anything onto your skin. Determine whether you need foundation or concealer. What spots do you need concealer on? Pat foundation and/or concealer. Never rub your foundation which can easily slide off your face. Blend the foundation or concealer in completely. Use foundation on your eyelids, and concealer under your eyes and anywhere on troubled spots. You can also use tinted moisturizers which gives you sheer, but great coverage, and light texture, safe, and sheer enough for summer! Use Clinique's concealers, and foundations which has the best quality, and variety. Use a powder to set foundation, and control too much shine on skin. Next apply cream blush, cheek stains. They give off a nice healthy flesh and a hint of shape in your facial structure. If you like powders, use them. Any blush is fine. Tarte, Fresh, and Loreal gives you excellent quality, more variety, and color. Smile and dust blush on the apples of your cheeks and blend with your fingers. *For eyes, apply a neutral shade from lashline to creases, and a coat of mascara. For a dramatic look for eyes don't be afraid to use a bit of color. The color has to be worn well though. It's not easy pulling off a color like hot pink on your eyelids. If you want a funkier approach know you're limits. What would look good against your complexion, what would look good with your outfit. You can be subtle. If you want apply eyeliner, and trace along your lashline, whether you want it from the bottom, or top. Curl top, and bottom lashes, and apply two coats of lengthening, and thickening mascara. Mascara can enhance your eyes, make them pop, and lashes look long, and voluminous, but to actually get that you need some good quality mascara. DiorShow mascaras are recommend, so be sure to invest in some good ones. Bobbi Brown has the best eye makeup products, highly recommended. ' * Keep lips soft and smooth always. Use a soft lip color like Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer Balm. It's the best for sheer color, that you can build on. Be sure to apply them on conditioned lips. After you're done with all of these steps take a chance to look over your makeup. Maybe you need more blending. If so blend more. You could of course skip most of these steps depending on how you like your make up. You may not like foundation, you don't have to use it. Many say you're suffocating skin using too much makeup which maybe true, so don't use any. If you're young and don't like too much makeup on some of these tips can still be required. So know your limits when it's coming to make up. 8. Take care of your nails. Keep them neat, and never use acrylic nails. Though they maybe pretty for awhile, your real nails would get damaged due to toxic glues holding the nail together. To get those perfect nails use the real ones you have. Get a regular traditional manicure every month or two at a local, trusted salon. But you can also get those perfectly manicure nails at home, which saves you time and money. Simply clean your nails before doing anything. Soak in warm water, and use a cuticle remover, then buff your nails until they're shiny. Bath and Body Works have some great quality nail buffers that'll last you, but you can get them nearly anywhere. Once your nails are shiny moisten the tips of your nails with water for an easier, cleaner, and smoother finish and apply white nail pencil on the tips of your nails. Select Sally Hansen, and OPI nail products, while they both have great quality nail products for less. To keep your healthy nails add calcium, vitamin A, protein, vitamin b12, folic acid, protein, and vitamin c will do, and prevent those nasty hangnails so find a way to slip those into your meals. 9. Take time for your hair. Wash your hair daily, and follow up with conditioning. When washing your hair with shampoo focus more on the roots. When conditioning focus more the on the ends of your hair. Dove, and Suave hair products work well and are inexpensive. But you can use any trusted product. Use a special formula especially for your hair whether it's colored, or relaxed. The main important thing to keeping hair healthy and growing is to trim your ends. Get them trimmed regularly 3-8 weeks MAX. No matter how much you cut off your hair grows quicker, and the ends of your hair won't be brittle and thin. Don't use rubber bands for ponytails or any updos. The healthiest is scrunchies for your hair, or metal less elastics. Be sure to add protein to keep hair shiny and strong. * Straightening your hair can destroy your hair, but not if you use a heat protectant for your mane. When you apply a heat protectant on your hair when straightening (or when using any other thermal tool), it's easier, comes out smoother, and shinier, and is easier to tame. To get that pin straight hair look apply straightening balm while hair is still wet. Allow hair to dry completely so there would be no frizzies. Brush moisturized hair while blowing drying. After hair dries creating sections in your hair, then flat iron big sections going from root to end. 10. Color your hair. But maintaining the color, and taking care of the health of your hair can be tricky. Choose a shampoo, and conditioner especially formulated for color treated hair obviously. Use trusted products to keep the color top notch. If you're new to coloring your hair and you don't really know what would look good on your hair, or you just want to experiment, try using Herbal Essences Colorflirt Mousse Hair Color. The results of the color is subtle, and it's very easy. But if you ever decide to color your hair the simplest way to do this is going to your hairstylist. It may cost but the results, and the products they use it top notch and does 5 times better, and healthier than at home treatments. Your hairstylist may also give you recommendations. They're professionals they know what looks good and what doesn't. 11. Make hair smell amazing by buying nice smelling shampoo that benefits hair. Buy what suits your hair needs, and a scent that pleases you. A great tip to keep hair smelling fresh is to use lemon juice on your hair after you shampoo, before you condition. For more fragrance apply a few mists of your favorite perfume onto your locks which lasts longer, and is more noticeable. 12. Get in shape. You don't need to to give up the foods you love just to be fit and healthy. Eat when your hungry, stop when you're full. It's as simple as that. But this doesn't mean you could eat up all the junk you can. You must add the needed nutrients and vitamins in your meal. Take vitamins before your meal. A much known rule to staying fit is to eat a full healthy breakfast. Just cereal wouldn't do the trick. Add bananas, orange juice, wheat bread with peanut butter into that and that's a simple meal. To be actively healthy take a nice walk around the park which is relaxing, just as they are exercising. Walking around the mall is another great alternative. Go to the gym. You must have a motivation and stick to it no matter how hard it may be. If you want to go to the gym which memberships can get pretty pricey check out some deals. If you're young and in school join a sport, even if you're not good at it they always say practice makes perfect. Do sports like soccer, lacrosse, basketball, and cheerleading. There's no excuse to not be into sports. We're young! You build stamina starting slow, and moving your way on up. But you have to push yourself to work. When you get tired take a break, then do it again the time you've got. 13. Buy pretty work out clothes. Who said you can't look pretty in the gym? Well certainly you can. Wear patterns, and wear leggings under your shorts, or under a long tunic. As long as you can move in the clothes when working out do so. Carry cute work out bags with your outfit. 14. Improve your posture walking with your head held high, and your shoulders back is a great way to show that you're confident. Body movement speaks volumes. Slouching on the other hand isn't pretty. Practice sitting at your computer desk. 15. Eating healthy can be pretty hard especially for those of us who hate eating green vegetables. Start buying organic foods, red meat, veggies, fruits. You could also make smoothies for your fruits, and/or vegetables. But be sure not to do this all the time. You won't really be keeping all of the nutrients you may expect. So try eating solid fruits, and vegetables. 16. Yummy perfume can make you feel fabulous Have you noticed you instantly feel confident applying the perfume you love? Perfume happens to tie the entire smell together giving off an irresistible scent. Spray too much you may scare someone away. Spray just a subtle amount that doesn't too much over powers your shampoo, and lotion. Spraying behind the ears, and one spritz on your hair is subtle, and gives off a sexy scent. If you can smell your purfume it's way too strong. To choose your signature scent test them out for yourself. Spray a tiny bit of the tester onto your wrist and let it sit to see if it has chemistry with your skin. Purfume can be irritating on skin. If you like the smell buy it! 17. Style it baby Every girl loves to shop. Be fashion forward, and create your own style! Don't be afraid to buy something different, funky, and non-trendy. Individuality is the key in fashion. Dare yourself to mix and match patterns, buy bold items, trendy items you love, and some items that aren't trendy that you love. Shop at vintage, or thrift stores. They're the best place to find hidden gems, that can be a signature of yours, something no one has. Just because the magazine doesn't has that certain item doesn't mean you can't wear it. When shopping instead pick out something makes you feel you, something that's bold, but makes you feel great, and confident. Always try on the clothing before buying. The fit also has a big impact on your style. If it fits perfectly, and you'll love it then buy it. This you saves time and money. To help complete a perfect outfit buy accessories! Buy funky, bold bangles to spice up a plain outfit, buy pearls to add elegance to an outfit. Buy wide belt over your top for a trendy effect to an outfit, headbands, and hair clips to accessorize your hair with, and oversized bags which can complete your outfit, and hold all of your necessities. 18.	No matter what knock offs are a no no. They're tacky, and dumb to carry around. Everyone would quickly assume you're cheap. Instead buy a real one. Save up your money to buy that designer bag, or shoes you always wanted. Shop at Macy's, Dillard's to get them as they do have nice sales and you save more money than buying with the regular price. Every penny counts. It's okay to buy inspirational designs...there's a fine line between inspiration, and knock offs.

And the always present but never written down ( written down here because I ca n't whisper it in your ear ) Eleventh Rule :	<insert><And><1>|||<replace><The><1><the><2>	Now, let's see how easy it is to turn it into a Religion!   1. You need an opposing force. Not necessarily an arch-enemy, but an opposite perspective so that people can pick sides and fight over things. * Remember the stuff about people up there in Number 5? If everybody gets along, nobody will ever hear about your new religion. Most people hardly ever talk about how happy and content they are with their spirituality. In fact, many feel that they have to impose their beliefs on others in order to validate themselves and their beliefs. Because if you can get other people to be convinced to believe the same thing you do, you must be right! And that validates your choices. You want to play into that if you're going to be creating your own religion.  In this case, we will create The Gentle Goddess Dietima.   1. Notice how we have used all the rules so far with this name and the subtle effects it engenders. Let's review: * It has "Diet" in the name, which is obviously the opposite of "Lard". It sounds Greek too, so it fits nicely into our freshly created pantheon of pseudo-Greek deities. 2. It sounds catchy. And it should. Because we have simply co-opted the name of an actual character from Greek Literature, Diotima. Many people will vaguely (but not quite) remember her name from a high school or college class. This is another great technique when you are creating a new religion: overlay your gods, legends, temples, holy days and whatever else you can think of over top of the ones used by The Other Religions. Why invent something new when you can simply co-opt it and claim it as your own? Then people can fight over who stole what from whom and the nefarious motivations for doing so. People love to fight, and it would be cruel of you to deny them this chance. * Who hasn't been on or thought about going on a diet? The Gentle Goddess Dietima is the patron for you!  Is there anyone you know that isn't painfully aware of diets and dieting? My point exactly.   * Notice how we have made The Gentle Goddess Dietima attractive to the entire spectrum of human emotion! Now we can just sit back and watch Her Faithful fight over which of her aspects is "The Real One". * The Gentle Goddess Dietima should always referred to as "The Gentle Goddess", unless you are in need of her unspecified warrior attributes which are whatever you want them to be whenever you want to use them. Good ol' rule number 5! 1. Dietima's symbols are the cute adorable little bunny (because nobody could not love a cute adorable little bunny), a curved silver knife (crescent moon shaped, great for cutting earth-friendly veggies to eat and tilling the ground, and useful for those unspecified warrior aspects, and similar enough to the Arch to cause more fun bickering) and the egg (fertility, orb shapes are common, and it will further confuse the whole spring holiday symbolism thing and cause more exciting discussions). So much for the review, now back to the recipe book:   1. You need to confuse everybody. This will make sure that nobody can be really certain WHAT they believe, because it is all so non-sensical to begin with. And when you don't spell it out exactly (or even if you do) you know how those funny humans will all magically just get along, right! In this case, we'll try to be real thorough here:   * The Gentle Goddess Dietima and The Great God Lardicus are Divine Brother and Sister. However, they are also Husband and Wife. And The Great God Lardicus is the child of Himself and The Gentle Goddess Dietima. As is Dietima. They love each other, but argue and even fight regularly for a variety of reasons that we won't go into here because we want people to make up their own reasons, which they can then fight over. * We don't even have to explain how any of this is possible because they are Gods and can do whatever they want. We don't want to specify who was born first or the details of their immaculate self-conceptions, because that might give one side the upper hand in any arguments. Remember Rule Number 5: Keep it ambiguous. * The Gentle Goddess Dietima and The Great God Lardicus may or may not have other children, parents, siblings or acquaintances. We can add them in later if we want or need to, and then the old-timers (historians, scholars, etc.) can fight the new converts (who are always the most passionate about things) about whether they should "really" be in the pantheon or not, since they weren't there in the beginning. We'll probably just say we found some ancient scrolls that nobody is allowed to examine that mentioned them when we want to add in any new characters. That'll be fun! 1. And last but certainly not least: The Big Reward. You know everything you always wished you had in this life? After you die, you'll get it! We promise! Hot women. Cute Guys. Flying Cars. Washboard abs. Rivers of Chocolate that won't add an ounce or an inch to your perfectly fit, weightless body. And lots of cute, adorable fluffy bunnies to frolic with in virgin green pastures.   * In our case, we guarantee that you'll get everything listed above. And then some!  But wait! There's more! All the people you love in this life will be there. But not the people you don't like. They all go to "The Other Place". Don't worry. They'll get theirs. And you'll spend eternity in Paradise. Really. We Promise.   1. Oh yeah, one last thing: *	.

Be prepared to spend a lot of money on your boat and on your equipment. * Take a few chartered fishing trips to catch bluefin before you strike out on your own. You'll learn about the procedure and about the equipment that you'll need, and you'll learn whether or not the sport is for you. * For winter fishing, check to see whether you have to follow the 2-engine rule.

Catch_Your_Crush's_Attention.txt	### Looking Your Best	If your crush is in your yoga class , do n't dress for class like you 're headed to the red carpet .	### Getting Noticed	For instance , if your crush is in your yoga class , do n't dress for class like you 're headed to the red carpet .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><instance><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><4>	Looking Your Best  1. Spend extra time on your appearance. Take the extra ten or fifteen minutes you need to look your absolute best before you see your crush. Even just small things can change you from someone in the background to the center of his or her attention. Not only can looking your best make your crush notice you, it can also give you the confidence boost you need to dazzle your crush. * Pay attention to your hair. Even doing a quick comb through can make a big difference. For many people, straightening or curling their hair can give them a confidence boost. * If you wear makeup, make sure that it is applied well and will last all day. * Also make sure that you are taking care of your body in general by getting enough sleep and taking care of your skin so you look fresh and healthy. 2. Define your style. Take a look at your wardrobe. Make sure that all your clothes feel like you, and aren’t just things that you’ve had for years and can’t bring yourself to get rid of. Your clothes are a great way to express yourself and show off your personality. If you have a very defined style, it can give your crush some idea of who you are and what you’re about, which could make your crush interested in talking to you. * If you’re feminine and cute, embrace this side of you by wearing pastels and lacy clothes. * If you’re more of a rebel, wear band shirts and black jeans. * Don’t copy your crush’s style. Just because your crush has a very preppy style, don’t think you have to dress like you’re going to a country club if that’s not your look. You need to feel comfortable and feel like yourself in your clothes. 3. Look different. Dressing differently than the people around you is a good way to get noticed. This works especially well if you are in an environment everyone dresses in a similar way. * If people at your school dress similarly or in uniform, wear a statement necklace or a pair of cool sneakers to catch the attention of your crush. * If you are in a professional work environment, wear something that is appropriate but different. For instance, wear a collared shirt with an interesting pattern or a sparkly headband. 4. Wear red. If red is your color, go for it. Studies show that both genders are more attracted to people when they wear red. Pull out a red dress or shirt from your closet to get your crush’s attention. If you don’t like wearing red, choose another bright color to help you stand out from the crowd. 5. Don’t go overboard. When trying to impress a crush, it’s easy to take it too far. You want to look nice, but remember to wear clothing that’s appropriate for the situation. * For instance, don’t start wearing heels to school if that’s not your usual style.	.

Remove all cables from the controller. As with the console, give yourself access to your charger’s ports for a more thorough clean. Unplug its charger cable. Do the same with your headphones if you have a pair of those plugged in, too. 2. Blast compressed air over your controller. Again, as with the console, start by removing as much dust as you can with your compressed air. Focus on the creases between the controller’s body and each button, pad, and analog stick, as well as any other gaps where dust may find its way into the controller’s interior. Be sure to give the ports for your cables a few short bursts, too. 3. Wipe it down. Unlike the console, your controller is held in your hands all the time, so you may need to clean more than dust off of it. Still, start off with a dry microfiber cloth and see how well that works on its own. If necessary, switch to a wet-wipe or dampen the corner of a clean cloth and use that. However, if you do either one, make sure to: * Use as little moisture as possible so your wet wipe or cloth isn’t dripping all over the place. * Avoid wiping near the charger port and headphone jack. *	.

Each planet occupies a particular zodiac sign at a given moment, and it is the interpretation of this placement that provides astrologers with insight into a person’s personality and behavior. To create a chart, you’ll first need some basic information about the subject, including their birth date, time, and place.	Once you’ve got your chart, you can read it for lots of different information about all aspects of your life.

Plan to do a strength training session of at least 30 minutes three days per week. 2. Take 36 to 48 hours of rest between sessions. If you are doing your sessions correctly, you will tear a lot of muscle fibers. Meanwhile, your body requires the rest to rebuild your muscles and make them stronger. * If you have limited time to devote to total body strengthening, isolate your upper body one day and your lower body the next. Ab strengthening can sometimes be done with only 24 hours of rest in between. 3. Choose a weight amount that only allows you to do 12 to 15 repetitions. While the argument used to be that heavier weights give you mass, while lighter weights with high reps give you definition, modern training suggests there is a happy medium. 4. Focus on quality of movement and good form. Don’t contract your muscles unless you can do it all the way. Move slowly through the pushing and pulling motions. 5. Do a set, then rest for 30 seconds to one minute. Repeat this for three sets. 6. Bring your muscles to fatigue.	If they don’t, you need to add more weight.

Make sure they do not set foot in the school grounds for any reason while on suspension unless supervised by you; for example to pick up a sibling from school or to attend a club meeting. If they are doing extracurricular activities at school usually they will be banned from doing these while on suspension. Some schools will call the police if a suspended student is on school property; however, most will force the parents or guardians to pick them up as soon as possible. 2. If the school has left school work for the child to do, make sure all of it is completed. This will help your child's return to school. They will not be as far behind on their classwork, and the school will be more willing to have them return to normal schedule. 3. Enforce some sort of punishment at home. Most kids don't see the act of actually being suspended as a punishment. They often see it as a reward; they're getting unexpected time off from school. If you issue a punishment at home it can help prevent the issue in future. Something suitable may be grounding your child, or withdrawing power cords and privileges such as TV, computer, and video games for the period of the suspension. This also applies if there will be a break between suspension days such as weekends, holidays, class suspension, etc. If unsure see "how to punish your child when they're suspended". 4.	.

That way, no one will give you, your wedding planner, or the hotel staff a hard time when they’re feeling lost. * Providing clear directions is especially important if you’re having a destination wedding. 2. Have someone ready to play referee. If a guest does start acting rude, demanding, or belligerent at your wedding, you shouldn’t be the one who has to deal with it. Enlist the help of your wedding planner or a friend to handle difficult guests. * Decide on a code word ahead of time to let the designated referee know that a guest is becoming a problem. 3. Set up activities for the kids. If you’ve invited children to your wedding and reception, a little extra thought can ensure they stay happy all night.	.

Determine the color of algae in your tank. Different kinds of algae thrive on different aquarium conditions. It's best to follow all of the steps to decrease algae naturally, but it's also important to get a feel for the type of algae causing the most problems so you know what the most effective solution will be. There are 4 main types of algae: blue-green, red, brown, and green. * Blue-green algae thrive in general poor water conditions. They develop on your fish, which will eventually start to look moldy—especially when they're motionless. * Red algae are caused by a lack of carbon dioxide and hangs all over your aquarium in threads. * Brown algae thrive in conditions with a lack of adequate light and form in large, brown layers. * Green algae are caused by too much light and can make your aquarium look like pea soup. 2. Test your aquarium water for phosphate and nitrate. Visit a local aquarium and purchase test kits for each chemical. Afterward, fill each testing tube to the required level and add your testing solution. Now, shake the tube and match the color of the water to the chart to determine the level of each chemical. * Nitrate levels should be between 20 and 40 ppm. * Ammonia levels should be below 0 ppm. 3. Decrease your tank's light exposure to prevent algae growth. Keeping the aquarium away from an unshaded window and only turning the aquarium lights on when viewing can decrease the green algae tremendously.	If you need to put your aquarium near a window, install some curtains so you can control the light exposure of your aquarium. In general, about 8 to 12 hours of light per day is ideal for aquariums with plants.

Even if it isn't on or hot, make sure it's unplugged to reduce the risk of electrical shock. 3. Wet a paper towel/ napkin with either water or all-purpose cleaning spray. All-purpose cleaning spray will work better than just plain water. 4. Take your unplugged curling iron and begin by wiping down the iron. If that didn't take off all the hairspray, or if you have a lot or hairspray stuck on, begin scrubbing the iron with the paper towel. Start off with the spots that have the most hairspray on them and make sure to scrub in all directions. This may take a while depending on how much hairspray is on the iron. Make sure to lift the clasp that closes on your hair when in use and clean under there! 5. Once you get the iron clean, wash your hands and grab a clean paper towel or napkin. If you used the all-purpose cleaner, wet the paper towel with water and wipe it down to remove any residue it may have left. Get a dry towel and begin drying off the iron, making sure that there is NO water left. 6.	.

Make sure you're not just being paranoid. Sometimes, it's not about you at all. Perhaps he or she is being quiet because someone in his or her family is ill, or is having personal problems. In this case, you shouldn't take it personally - back off a little and leave some space. But, if you notice that this person is only acting quietly towards you and not towards others for an extended period of time then you may have reason to be concerned. 2. Test the waters with a sense of humor. If the person is just in a bad mood (maybe because of something you did, maybe not) you might be able to lighten the mood with a little bit of playfulness. 3. Examine if this is a pattern. Has this person done this before? Does s/he try to control or "punish" you in other ways? If so, ask yourself whether this is a relationship you want to maintain. See How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship. 4. Question your own behavior. When did the silent treatment start? What happened that day, or in the days just before the behavior changed? Could you have done or said something insensitive? Did something change? Try to understand what could set off the silence. Narrow it down to a few possibilities and try to think of ways you can fix the situation. 5. Rehearse what you're going to say. You want to have one conversation and then feel like you said what you needed to say, so plan it ahead of time. It's easy to get nervous and/or defensive, or to come off the wrong way, if you aren't prepared. Close your eyes and imagine you're alone with this person and say out loud what you want to say. Listen to the way you make your statement, and adjust your tone if need be. 6. Speak in private. Speak to the person when you're alone and are unlikely to be interrupted. 7. Begin by apologizing if you believe you did something to offend or hurt the person, even if you're not sure what it is. Say something like "I'm so sorry if I've done or said something stupid to you." 8. Say that you value the friendship. E.g. "I've really enjoyed spending time/working with you." or "Please help me out here, because I appreciate your friendship so much." 9. Honestly express how this makes you feel. The cold shoulder is painful to the recipient (you). Let this person know that you do sincerely want to work things through, but if that's not going to happen in the near future, you may not continue "volunteering" to be frozen out. Example: "It really hurts that you're shutting me out, and I wish you would talk to me so we could put this behind us. The reality is that I think about this so much that I can't study or even sleep, so if this continues much longer, I'm going to need to stop waiting and just assume that you do not want to be friends anymore. I don't want to do that, which is why I'm telling you now." 10. Be open to whatever s/he has to say. Let him or her know that if there's a problem, you're all ears.	Paraphrase, make educated guesses: "and that made you feel sad?", and use stories to reach mutual understanding.

Talking to dog owners can provide additional advice. 6. Decide whether you want a purebred or a mixed-breed dog. If you plan to show or breed your dog, then choose a purebred. If not, keep in mind that mixed-breed dogs can be just as loyal and lovable. 7. Decide whether you want a puppy or an adult dog. Many wonderful puppies and adult dogs have been abandoned or given up to animal shelters or breed rescue groups, and adopting a pet from one of these sources may mean saving a life. 8. Ask the seller to tell you about particular habits or personality traits the dog exhibits. 9.	Be sure that each parent belongs to an entirely different family and has been screened for common genetic or inheritable diseases.

You talk about ball pythons for a little bit and then, you say, "Could I have a ball python for a pet?" They say "No" but you don't give up. You tell them about ball pythons and talk about why they are great pets to have. They ask questions, all of which you answer. You ask them why they don't like the idea of a pet snake. Then you give a solution to the problem. If your mom thinks it would be too much work, tell her how low-maitnence most snakes are.

Make an appointment with a dermatologist. Discuss, and show, your specific acne problem to a dermatologist and work with them to develop a personalized treatment plan for your specific situation. This treatment plan might include advice on what products to use (and not to use) on your face and possibly prescription medication. Dermatologists may prescribe you: topical antibiotics (i.e. a cream) that you can dab onto your problem areas to help control the bacteria that is causing your acne; oral antibiotics (i.e. a pill) that would be similar to something you’d take if you had another internal infection, like a bladder infection; topical retinoid medications, which are made from vitamin A and can help unclog your pores, and they can also help antibiotics work more effectively; isotretinoin, which is an oral retinoid and can help reduce the amount of sebum your pores produce, which in turn will help reduce inflammation and acne. * Some doctors may also consider prescribing oral contraceptives (i.e. birth control pills) to young women with acne problems. Some low-dose oral contraceptives, which contain a combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin, can actually help control and reduce the amount of acne on your skin. *	If it is prescribed, it is normally only taken for 4-5 months. While it has good success rates with getting rid of acne, it also has some very serious side effects. It can increase the amount of fat in your blood to risky levels, and it can impact the function of your liver. Doctors will usually test your blood regularly throughout the time you’re on isotretinoin to monitor these potential side effects. The worst side effect of isotretinoin is birth defects. Obviously this means it should never be taken if you are pregnant, think your might be pregnant, or are trying to get pregnant.

With the arrival of the Huggies Pull-Ups Goodnites diapers to the United States in 1994, came first and for a long time the only bedwetting diaper commonly found on store shelves nationwide. In 2008, Pampers began to quell the competitors actions a bit, and came out with their own disposable bedwetting product: the Pampers Underjams. * If at any point during the changing process you notice the child begin to develop a rash, liberally apply diaper rash ointment/cream to the affected area. * Be aware of the features of some store-brand disposable bedwetting diapers that have come onto the scene. They may have even more features that those that aren't found in this article. * Most bedwetters don't want to expose their secrets to too many people, so calling these pants by the common name "diapers" is just awful, and most feel infantile if you call these pants by that stereotype. Instead, refer to these diapers as just "pants". And try not to use either term when talking to your child in public about these pants they wear. * Some bedwetting diaper styles may differ than the ones presented here. Some bedwetting diapers can be changed by just removing the old diaper by ripping the sides and pulling a new diaper up into position. (Please be forewarned, that this style MAY have an icon on the one side of the diaper; this is the icon that references the back of the pant.) However, check the product's packaging to see if these bedwetting diapers have this feature or not. * Do not believe a child is beginning to bedwet, if there is sickness in the house, and they pee on the bed only once. Sickness generally causes great inconvenience on the child's digestive and urinary systems, before affecting other bodily systems. * Changing a bedwetting diaper can be done on a bed, sofa, or another flat surface. Just like a disposable diaper, it too, can be changed on a changing table, if the child is young enough and small enough in length to fit on the table itself, and the diaper-changing parent is willing to strap the child down with the table's straps during the night. * Kids: It is okay to talk to your parents or doctor about your bedwetting accidents. They care about you, despite the way they may look at times. If you feel embarrassed by telling your parents, realize nothing worse can come out of it, and that you will be cured soon if you do. It is definitely treatable when seen by a doctor. * It is fairly common to see kids have nighttime wetting accidents as they begin to potty-train. Mastering the art of nighttime potty-training will take a bit longer to achieve. It may also re-erupt, if a new difficult decision begins or a severe traumatic experience happens (loss/death of a loved relative, divorce, birth of another child, changing of the child's school, etc.). Try and discuss these wetting incidents with the child's doctor as soon as possible, as bedwetting is curable with the right medications. Only use bedwetting diapers as the method of last-resort or for short periods of time. *	.
Choose_Hypertension_Medication.txt	## Steps	Patients who have been diagnosed with angina along with hypertension might see greater results with a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker .	### Working with Your Doctor	Also , patients who have been diagnosed with angina along with hypertension might see greater results with a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker .	<insert><Also><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Patients><1><patients><3>	Steps  1. Ask if your high blood pressure is stage 1 or stage 2. * Once you are diagnosed with hypertension, you will be given either a stage 1 or stage 2 classification for your disease. Stage 1 high blood pressure is for individuals having a systolic (top) reading of 140 to 159 mm Hg and having a diastolic (lower) reading between 90 and 99 mm Hg. Stage 2 high blood pressure is diagnosed in a patient who usually has a systolic reading of 160 mm Hg or higher, and a diastolic reading of 100 mm Hg or higher. 2. Learn about the different types of methods for treating high blood pressure. * There are many possible medications for treating high blood pressure today, including calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Each medication works in a slightly different manner. For example, diuretics rid the body of excess water and sodium which lowers blood pressure. Beta-blockers work by lowering heart rate and cardiac output. ACE inhibitors reduce strain on the heart by helping blood flow more easily. * While diuretics are often the first course of action, a doctor may also prescribe an additional or replacement medication if the diuretic does not significantly lower blood pressure. Many patients may take a combination of medication to keep hypertension in check and reduce the risk of complications from high blood pressure. 3. Identify other medical conditions that could impact the effectiveness of your medication. * For example, diuretics are not recommended for patients with diabetes, since these drugs can increase blood sugar levels in the body.	Your doctor needs to know your full medical history to find the best hypertension drug for you.

Paint the balloons to add personal detail and decorations. Whether you are hanging balloons from the wall or creating colorful displays, feel free to grab some acrylic paint and a small paintbrush to add unique touches. Pick your accents based on the theme of the party. * For example, you can paint the number your child is turning onto the balloon, add polka dots all over, or paint smiley faces on each one. 2. Tie decorative ribbon or string to your balloons to embellish them. You can essentially decorate the string of your balloon however you’d like! Use washi tape in your party colors for a quick accent. Rip small pieces and fold them over the string. Add a piece of string every until you reach the end. Or, tie multiple pieces of ribbon long to the tail of the balloon for a bit of color. * You can tie single balloons filled with helium to the back of each chair, for example. * In addition, you can tie glitter garland to the string of your balloon for an instant upgrade. 3. Put a glow stick inside each balloon to create a glowing display. Before you blow up the balloon, bend a glowstick back and forth to make it glow, and place it inside the balloon. Then, blow up your balloon as normal, knot the bottom when it is full, and tie on a string. * This makes your balloons glow in the dark, which can be a fun addition to a birthday celebration. * This is a great idea if you are hosting a laser tag party, for instance. 4. Attach a paper cone to the balloon to make an ice cream decoration. Gather 1 piece of brown construction paper for each balloon you inflate. Twist the paper into a cone shape, and use a stapler to secure it into place. Then, slip the string of your balloon through the cone, and reposition it overtop the tail end. Place a few dots of craft glue along the top edge of the “cone” to secure it onto the balloon. * Do this for each of your individual balloons to make a fun, summery decoration. * This is a great idea if you are hosting a party at a swim club, for example. 5. Use pieces of paper to turn your balloons into pieces of fruit. First, pick out which fruit you’d like to make. You can make fruit including pineapples, grapes, and bananas.	Draw a leaf on a green piece of construction paper, and cut it out with a pair of scissors. Secure the balloons together using double-sided tape to make your bunch shape. Tie a string to 1 of the balloons, and tape the leaf onto the balloon where you attach the string.

First, before you leave home, decide what you will do about toilet paper. If you insist on having in, be warned you will have to carry the used paper out with you, preferably double-bagged. A more environmentally friendly (and less disgusting) method is to use "natural toilet paper" - leaves, sticks, pinecones, etc. 2. When you feel the urge to go, always tell someone else in the group where you are going. This way, they can look out for you, and if you do not return after a short time, they will look for you to make sure you are safe. 3. Head out into the forest far enough so that people can no longer see you. If it is dark, do not wander too far from your camp, ask someone to accompany you, and always take a flashlight with you. Find a place at least 100 feet from camp and the trail, and 200 feet from water sources. 4. Once you reach a desired place, grab a stick (or bring a small shovel) and dig a hole at least 6 inches deep. This hole will function the same as an outhouse hole. Also make sure there are no animals or poison ivy around. 5. Do your business in the hole, and take care of the paperwork. 6. Place the dirty paper, if you used it, in a 'ziplock' freezer bag so you can pack it out. 7.	.

Find a new tunnel or mound. A new tunnel or mound will most likely have a mole digging through rather frequently. Check on the tunnel or mound frequently during the early morning or evening to see if you notice any movement just underneath the surface of the soil. Moles tend to do most of their digging during the early morning and evening, so this is the best time to look out for them. 2. Approach the tunnel or mound. Wait and watch the tunnel or mound to see movement as the mole digs through. When you see movements, approach the tunnel or mound very slowly so as not to alert the mole. 3. Spade the mole out of the ground. Strike a spade or shovel deep into the ground (about 6–8 inches deep) behind the mole. Striking the spade or shovel behind the mole will prevent it from escaping as you try to remove them from the ground. * This can be a humane way to remove moles from your yard, but it can leave large holes and divots in your grass. *	.

Think about the benefits of forgiveness. It can be very hard to forgive someone who has stabbed you in the back. However, there are many emotional and physical benefits that occur when you forgive someone who has wronged you. When you are consciously aware that your own well-being will actually improve when you forgive your friend, you may be more motivated to do so. Here are some of the benefits of forgiving others: * Decreased depression and lessened anxiety * Greater overall psychological well-being * Reduced levels of stress * Greater spiritual connection * Strengthened immune system * Lower blood pressure and improved heart health * Better interpersonal relationships * Increased self-esteem 2. View the situation from the other person’s perspective. Sometimes unintentional betrayal happens because of a misunderstanding. Therefore, it’s important to consider the other person’s perspective. Taking time to reflect on the intention behind the behavior from the person’s perspective can really help you begin the process of forgiving him. 3. Focus on compassion. Showing compassion when someone betrays you is difficult but it is essential to the forgiveness process. The most effective way to demonstrate compassion is to consider how the other person may actually be feeling right now.	.

Many people when faced with a doctor go blank! A pen to write down what the doctor says is handy, too. Many patients often remember things they want to ask the physician after the visit has concluded and are then embarrassed to call back about it. * Do not wait till the end of the meeting to say "...and, by the way, I have this other pain". This is terribly inconvenient to doctors since something that you think is minor might change their whole treatment plan. Tell them all of your symptoms up front before they start working on a diagnosis. * Make a list of questions you have for your doctor. Most of the time, due to time constrains, You will forget what you were supposed to ask, so it is important to have a list. * Honesty is key. Physicians are bound by a duty of confidentiality. If your continued health is at stake, you may as well tell them every detail. * Look the part.	If you are complaining of a sore toe, don't have the doctor enter the room to find you laying on the exam table in a medical gown.

Locate a yoga mat and a medicine ball. You can also use a carpeted area, but a yoga mat is preferable, as you want to be able to keep your body as straight as possible throughout the exercise. * Medicine balls come in a variety of weights from 2lbs. to 30lbs. and can be made of hard plastic, dense rubber or synthetic leather material. * Choose the type and weight that works best for your level of fitness. It’s better to start with a lighter weight ball and work your way up to a heavier one to avoid injuries. 2. Place the medicine ball in front of the mat. The ball should not be directly in front of the mat, but placed within arm's reach. * The ball will need to be located on one of the shorter ends of the mat. 3. Lay face down and extend your arms out to grab the ball. Your head should be facing the ball. When you extend your arms to grab the ball keep them as straight as possible. * Give yourself enough space to fully extend your body without bumping into anything. 4. Now raise your arms and legs at the same time. With the ball in hand, raise your arms and legs at the same time. Hold the position for a minute or two at the top. * Keep your core tight and make sure to keep breathing! 5. Lower your arms and legs to the ground slowly. Don’t hurry this part of the exercise. Take a deep breath and slowly bring your arms and legs to the ground. * Your core should still be tight and you should feel the muscles in both your back and abs being worked. 6. Repeat 10 times. Try to do two or three sets of 10. This beginner level exercise will help to work your lower back. The lower back is often not trained because it is not visible in the mirror.	.

Remember that White Sands is in the middle of a desert, so you should take the same precautions as you would if you were going to the beach. * Put on sunscreen, the white sand reflects solar rays upward. If you have sensitive eyes, bring sunglasses and a hat as well. * Wear an old pair of shoes, or at least bring an extra pair with you. They will definitely get loaded with sand, which is much finer than the sand on beaches. If you don't want too much sand in the car, bring another pair of shoes and put plastic or sheets on the upholstery. On the dunes themselves, it is fairly safe to go barefoot, but there is a small risk stepping on litter or a tarantula. The sand itself, though, is easy on bare feet, unless it's in the winter, in which case it can be cold (It really doesn't heat up too much in the summer, due to its highly reflective qualities). 2. Visit the information/education center to learn how White Sands was formed. You can ask the employees for an abridged explanation or you can walk through the adjoining room to get a more detailed understanding. Maps, books, and other useful items can be found here as well. 3. Visit the gift shop. Here, you can: * Purchase unique souvenirs for friends and family (e.g. prickly pear candy, stone night lights, White Sands post cards and magnets, t-shirts, etc.). * Rent or buy a plastic sled for downhill sledding on sand dunes. Don't forget the wax! If you buy a sled you can return it and receive a portion of your initial payment. If renting one, try to avoid scratched-up ones. The new, slick ones are faster. * Use the bathroom. These bathrooms are much nicer than the ones you'll find on the sands. 4. Pay at the ticket booth. Each adult pays a fee but children get in for free. Tickets are valid for 7 days. As you begin driving through, you'll see the landscape gradually change. It'll take about 15 minutes before you reach pure white sand. Be sure to get enough information brochures from the booth for everyone interested. 5. Check out the boardwalk, but be careful for static electricity. Running your hand along the railing will generate static electricity that can cause mild discomfort if you touch a metal object (such as the screws in the railing). This can be a lot of fun, though, if you chase someone up and down the boardwalk and zap them with your finger! 6. Drive around to explore the area, and make sure not to park on the road; if you do, staff will ask you to move. Look for pull-off areas. 7. Slide down the dunes with your sled(s). Simply wax your board (with canning or candle wax) and slide down, making sure to avoid sliding into the road! The steepest slopes are by the picnic area. 8. Take pictures and video footage with a camcorder. Because of the brightness level outside, you'll have to adjust your lenses accordingly. Note in the picture to the right how the white sand washes out into the white background. 9. Walk away from the road and into the sand for a few minutes to put some distance between you and the main road. Stand still and notice the quietness around you. Also, look down and try to spot traces of animal life, such as bird tracks or scattering ants. 10. Stay for the sunset stroll. White Sands looks very pretty at that time, and there's a guided walk, usually at 4pm. Consult the visitor center for when and where the walk starts. 11. Stick around the area because your ticket will allow you to reenter without additional charges for up to 7 days. 12.	Take advantage of this as it give a very different perspective.

Do_Forward_Splits.txt	## Section::::Sources and Citations.	Never stretch to the point of pain .	### Doing stretches to prepare you for the split	However , never stretch to the point of pain .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Never><1><never><3>	Many dancers have trouble getting their splits. Flexibility is important for dancing, as many dance steps are nearly impossible to perform without being extremely limber. The ability to sit in split positions will greatly improve lower body flexibility and increase maximum extension. In dance, a front split is named according to the leg that is extended to the front. (If the right leg is extended forward, the split is referred to as a right split). Doing splits is easier for some dancers than others, so don't be discouraged if it takes you a little longer to get them. If you would like to get your front or straddle splits, or improve on the ones you already have, try to stretch every day. Stretching can be fun, but it should also be a bit challenging. Begin each stretching session with easy and gentle stretches.	.

Ask your parents for their blood type. If your biological parents both know their blood type, that narrows down the possibilities. In most cases this is only enough to guess, using an online blood type calculator or the following list: * O parent x O parent = O child * O parent x A parent = A or O child * O parent x B parent = B or O child * O parent x AB parent = A or B child * A parent x A parent = A or O child * A parent x B parent = A, B, AB or O child * A parent x AB parent = A, B or AB child * B parent x B parent = B or O child * B parent x AB parent = A, B or AB child * AB parent x AB parent = A, B or AB child * Blood types also include an "Rh factor" (+ or -). If both of your parents have an Rh- blood type (such as O- or AB-), you are also Rh-. If one or both of your parents are Rh+, you cannot tell whether you are + or - without a test. 2. Call a doctor who has drawn your blood. If your physician already has your blood type on file, then you just need to ask. However, they will only have your record on file if you've already had your blood drawn and/or tested.	.

Feel_Lucky.txt	### Using Good Luck Charms	Clean up around the front door .	### Using Good Luck Charms	So clean up around the front door .	<insert><So><1>|||<replace><Clean><1><clean><2>	Using Good Luck Charms  1. Supplement your hard work with lucky charms. While it may seem superstitious to some, it's true that adorning yourself with lucky totems or keeping an eye out for lucky signs can help lots of people feel more lucky. You shouldn't stake all your good feelings on arbitrary symbols and signs, but it's perfectly healthy to feel fortunate on any day you're landed on by a ladybug, or any day that starts with a positive omen. 2. Look for lucky insects and animals. Across cultures, insects and other animals are often thought of as being either unlucky, or lucky, depending on the situation. If you're out among the wildlife, keep an eye out for the following lucky insects or animals: * Crickets. Crickets are though to bring good luck from Europe to Asia, as well as the Native American tribes who thought of crickets as bringers of fortune. In some cultures, imitating the sound of a cricket is seen as unlucky. * Ladybugs. Some people think that a ladybug that lands on a recently-wedded woman will reveal the number of children she will have in its spots, or the number of dollars soon to be found. Also, ladybugs are thought to bring signs of good weather. Never kill a ladybug if it lands on you. * Dragonflies, scarabs, rabbits, eagles, tortoises, dolphins, frogs, bats and many other animals are also commonly thought of as being lucky. If you've got a favorite animal, carry a picture or a totem of that animal with you for luck. 3. Keep lucky plants. Aromatic and lovely, keeping plants in your house can be a wonderful way of livening up your space, as well as a symbol of wealth and prosperity in many cultures. Different plants are thought to have a variety of luck-bringing properties. Some common lucky house plants include: * Honeysuckle, lavender, and jasmine are some of the most aromatic plants you can grow, instantly bringing soothing scents into your space. Some people think that the presence of these plants can help to influence your dreams, easing you off to sleep and helping to ease you into a new day of luck and fortune. * Bamboo is one of the luckiest plants, thought to bring wealth, creativity, and health to the planters. Bamboo forests are considered mystical and sacred places in many cultures. * Basil, rosemary, and sage are all thought to be protective herbs to grow in your home, or around your home. Tenacious plants in many climates, these aromatic herbs are useful in cooking and were even commonly used in exorcisms. 4. Wear lucky charms. You don't have to go out looking for lucky charms–bring them with you! Having a lucky necklace, rabbit's foot charm, or other little trinket in your pocket can give you feelings of fortune that will help translate into positive actions and luck-making behaviors. * Carrying acorns, buckeyes, or stones in your pocket is a common practice among farmers. Guitar players will sometimes have lucky picks and athletes will have lucky t-shirts. * Whether or not a particular object is actually powerfully lucky doesn't really matter. What matters is that it helps you to feel lucky, which can influence your behavior. 5. Make your space lucky. While it may sound silly, organizing your house according to the principles of design will help to channel your positivity and your lucky energy into good behaviors. If you feel good by creating a lucky and healthful space for yourself, you'll behave in ways that suit your best interests. * Unclutter the entryway to your house. The entrance to your house to emphasize flowing energy and positivity. Keeping unwieldy stacks of mail, keys, and shoes near the entrance won't help you feel lucky when you're heading off into the world or when you're coming up.	.

Create a safe play space for them. If you need to get some work done, it’s important to remember that you can’t really take your eyes off a toddler for more than a few seconds at a time. You need to make sure you’re situated in a spot where you can see them clearly, and that the play area is properly toddler-proofed. * If you’re letting them play in your home office, for instance, make sure you protect or remove any electrical or wiring hazards, sharp objects, hard surfaces, and choking hazards. It may be better, in fact, to set up a mini workspace for yourself in the child’s typical play area. 2. Record yourself reading their favorite books. Reading directly to a toddler is much more interactive and personal, of course. But, when you need to get a few things done, handing them one of their books while you play audio of you reading it can provide a useful distraction. * You could also create a video of yourself reading the book and holding up the pictures, then play it back on a TV or other screen. 3. Set up a “movie theater” for watching TV. Plopping a toddler in front of a TV to keep them occupied isn’t an ideal solution, but it may be your best option in some circumstances. Make it a bit more engaging by helping them set up their dolls or stuffed animals in chairs to watch the show with them. You might even make up tickets to sell for the show! * Use this only as a short-term alternative when you don't have better options. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no "screen time" for kids under 18 months, very limited screen time with an adult watching along at 18-24 months, and no more than 1 hour per day of solo screen time from 2-5 years. * In all cases, choose educational programming with limited or no advertising. 4.	Toddlers are often fascinated by seeing themselves on the big screen, so queue up some home movies for them to watch. They might be especially intrigued by seeing themselves as a tiny baby!

Prepare answers for typical questions about felonies and being dismissed. Many applications will want to know if you've been convicted of a felony, if you've been convicted of driving offenses, and if you've ever been fired, forced to resigned, or resigned in order to avoid being fired before. 3. Gather other essential information such as your driver’s license and other forms to document your identity. In the United States, you need a Social Security number. 4. Prepare a list of references with each person's name, their job title or relation to you, and their contact information. Most applications will want three references, and some companies will only want professional references. Keep a list that is a mix of professional and personal references so you can easily pick and choose who to list on each application. At minimum, you should have a list of six references: three personal references and three professional references. 5. Write a formal resume. When filling out an application in person, including a professional-looking resume can help you stand out. When applying online, you'll frequently be prompted to upload or include a resume while also filling out an application that includes much of the same information. * If the position you're applying for requires a photograph, give the most recent photograph available. Don't just cut your face from a group photo and just that. Get a professional photo taken, especially if you are applying for a job in an image-minded industry. 6. If you'll be filling out applications in person, bring a couple black pens, all the information you've prepared and some blank paper. 7. Dress in appropriate attire when asking for applications and when turning them in.	.

Notice signs in young children. Girls acting like a “tomboy” can be normal behavior, as can boys playing dress-up in their mother’s or sister’s clothes. Exploring activities and preferences is a part of normal development. Yet, for many children, these behaviors often evolve or change with time. For others, the mismatch of gender identity is distressing and persists throughout development. * Notice how the distress of being the “wrong” sex affects your child. 2. Be aware of a child insisting they are the opposite sex. A child may tell others that they are the other sex. A child you thought to be a boy may say she is a girl, and a child you thought to be a girl may insist he is a boy. * Sometimes a child may rename themselves based off of their gender identity. For example, a trans girl named Stephen may write "Stephanie" on all her notebooks, and light up if you start calling her this. * A child may correct others about their gender, and surprise adults when told "boys line up here." 3. Watch for toy and activity refusal. A child may express a strong dislike of activities that are associated with the gender adults perceive them to be. These can include tea parties and dress up for trans boys, or pretending to be cowboys and wrestling for trans girls. The child may also refuse to play with typical toys associated with the gender. Instead, the child may prefer toys and activities more commonly associated with their true gender. * Refusal may be out of genuine dislike, or for fear of being called the wrong gender. Some children will not display this trait. 4. Recognize a dislike of their anatomy.	The child may insist or hope that the genitals will change in development.

Know your chances for plastic or metal slinkies. This method is for slinkies that aren't tangled, but have developed bent coils or "kinks" that refuse to line up with the other coils. Some plastic slinky kinks can be molded back into place when heated, but this won't always work and could even melt your toy if you're not careful. Metal slinkies are much harder to bend back, so only try it if you have time to spare and really don't want to buy a replacement. 2. Heat a pot of water. Fill a pot with enough water to cover the slinky. Heat it on the stove alone, without the slinky in it. You do not want the water to boil, but keep heating it until it becomes quite hot, perhaps just beginning to steam. * You could microwave a bowl of water instead, or heat water in the kettle and pour it into a pot. 3. Turn off the heat. Turn off the heat once the water is hot. Never keep heating the water after the slinky is in it, or the slinky could melt and ruin both itself and the container it's in. 4.	Put on rubber gloves to protect your hands, and lower the slinky into the hot water. Leave it there for a couple minutes.

Fertilize at the right time. Spring is the best time, before the leaves grow. 2. Have the soil tested. You won't know how to correct it for the sake of better blueberry plants. Almost all fruits do best in slightly acidic soil, somewhere between a pH of 5.5 and 6.5. Blueberries prefer a soil of even greater acidity of between 4.09 and 5.0. The soil acidity is an important part of proper fertilization of the blueberries. * Blueberries thrive in acidic soils. One 4-cubic foot compressed bale will usually be sufficient for four to five plants, for raised beds mix equal volumes peat moss with acid compost or planting mix. Your garden center representative can recommend a soil acidifier if necessary for your soil. 3. Choose a fertilizer high in nitrogen. However, the fertilizer must not contain calcium nitrate or chloride as these can kill some blueberry plants. The fertilizer should contain ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate or sulfur-coated urea. These ingredients ensure that the pH is lower and the acid level higher. 4. Ensure that the blueberry plant is not deficient in iron or magnesium. If you see red to yellow leaves, this signifies a deficiency in magnesium, while yellow leaves with green veins signifies a possible iron deficiency. The fertilizer should contain either or both of these nutrients, as required. 5. Make your own fertilizer for blueberries.	.

So be quick to forgive those little mistakes or annoying habits that don't really matter, and hopefully he will overlook your imperfections too. Understand what types of annoying habits rile you so much they're a deal-breaker and be up front about those, as well as those you don't think of as a big deal. If you can't stand a forgetful man, you may have to bend on something else to find one who never forgets an anniversary or errand.

Assemble four sheets of origami paper. 2. Start with the colour-side of the paper facing down. Fold the paper in half diagonally and open it back up. 3. Fold point A and the rest of the paper to the right to meet the centre. * Fold point B and the rest of the paper to the left to meet the centre. 4. Fold point C (see picture) the same as you folded point A. (They will overlap.) 5. Fold point D the same as you folded point B. (They will overlap.) 6. Pick up the unit in half at the centre crease. (All the flaps made in the last few steps will be on the inside. 7. Bring points E and F together to fold the unit in half. Crease well and unfold. 8. Fold point E down to the crease you made in the last step. 9. Turn the unit over. Fold point F down on the middle crease. 10. Repeat the above process. At this point, you have made one completed unit. Make 3 more of these. Unfold the last two folds in each unit so that it is a long triangle with three creases. 11. Now assemble them. This is tricky, so make sure you have a good grip on all of them; they will slide around. Lining up the creases well is very important. Lay down two of the units side by side, with the long edges against each other. 12. Notice the line in the centre of both units. 13. Slide another unit in the top, over A but behind B. Slide it down to the centre. This is where you need to make sure you have a very good grip on the units. 14. Slide the last unit in from the bottom, but let unit A be on top this time, and unit B will be underneath. 15. Examine the crease on on unit D (see picture – the dotted line). * Fold up on the crease. 16. Examine the crease on the bottom half of unit A. * Fold to the right on the crease. 17. Examine the crease on unit C. * Fold down on the crease. 18. For this step, examine B, which D is covering. Carefully fold D down (but do not crease) just enough that you can fold B to the left. Put D back in its original position. 19. Repeat steps 15-18 until there is not enough paper to do any more layers. There are no more creases as guides, but fold them the same way. 20. Turn the over and repeat steps 15-18 on this side. When there is not enough paper to make another layer, twist the tips clockwise to the way the spirals go. Do this on both sides. 21.	You're done!

Make your little actions work for what you want to do. Start by doing tiny things that steer you in the direction of the habits you want to make. For example, if you want to go jogging daily because you know you need the exercise to stay focused on what you want to do. Put on your jogging shoes every day for five days at the time you would want to go jogging. Eventually you will go jogging because it you are ready for jogging. This is going to be the fastest way for you to change your habits. Doing these tiny actions consistently will start to lead you into doing the bigger actions. 2. Know the difference between your feelings and what you want. What you want is bigger than your moods. For example, you want to become a good musician so you can teach others through music therapy.	Here your feelings are perhaps stubborn and insubordinate, but what you want is still to practice your instrument.

Give your dog medication. Medication can often be used to treat endocrine disorders that produce too much hormone. Syndromes that are caused by hormone deficiency are often treated by replacing the missing hormone. The most common example of this type of treatment is insulin injections that are used to treat diabetes. * Medications used for endocrine disorders are sometimes injected, as in the case of insulin, but are often given orally. This is the case for steroid and thyroid hormone replacements. * Medications are often a good treatment option for senior dogs, as undergoing more invasive types of treatment could be too much for their aging bodies. 2. Have your dog undergo radiotherapy.	This type of treatment uses radiation to eliminate tissues that are malfunctioning.

Determine the dog's weight and height. If you don't have a pet scale, weigh yourself and then weigh yourself holding your dog. Of course, you can also get your pet’s weight at any veterinary office.  * Take measuring tape and measure your dog from front to back, top to bottom, and left to right. * These general measurements will allow you to rule out breeds that are drastically different from your dog. For instance, if your dog weighs 50 pounds, you will know that you don't have a small toy breed. 2. Assess the build of your dog. Make note of any defining characteristics you notice. Do you have a large, medium or small-framed dog? Deep chested? Is your dog more muscular or slender in build?  * If you have a puppy, you may have to wait until it is fully mature for all characteristics to become apparent. * Think about what the build of your dog might mean about its skills. This may help you narrow down the breed group. For instance, if your dog has long legs and is slender, your dog may be a herding dog. 3. Look at other physical characteristics. Look at your dog's snout, skull, back, legs, and tail. Dogs like pugs and bulldogs have round skulls and very short snouts (brachycephalic), whereas collies and greyhounds have long snouts and narrow skulls (dolichocephalic). Mesocephalic dogs have skulls that most of us think are balanced (not exaggerated), like that of a Labrador or an Australian shepherd. * Giant breed dogs are huge in all respects and include Great Danes and Mastiffs, large breed dogs include German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers, medium sized dogs include Cocker Spaniels and Shetland Sheepdogs, small breeds include Chihuahuas and Shih Tzu’s. 4. Evaluate the fur. Is the fur long or short or heavy with undercoat? Is the texture coarse or soft? Some breeds, like dachshunds, have long backs and short legs and three different types of fur-coat: Long, short and wiry. Other breeds only have one type of fur, like the short semi-spiky velvet of the Chinese sharPei breed.  * There are a wide variety of types of dog fur. Rottweilers tend to only come with short black and mahogany specific markings on the head and chest. Many (not all) terriers have wiry coats with short stocky bodies like that of the cairn terrier, the miniature schnauzer and the Jack Russell (aka Parsons) terrier. Poodles have the distinction of having curly coats of springy curls in a variety of sizes and colors. 5. Assess the color of your dog. What color is the fur? Is there a pattern to the coat color? Some breeds typically come in only one or a few colors or patterns, which may help narrow the possibilities.  *	There are breeds that also come in a merle pattern where diluted black or red colors are mixed in with white like the blue merle Australian shepherd or Shetland sheepdog.
Determine_Directions_to_North,_South,_East,_and_West.txt	### Determining Direction With Magnetic or Electronic Devices	Use the pliers to push the needle through the cork disk .	### Making Your Own Compass	Then , use the pliers to push the needle through the cork disk .	<insert><Then><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Use><1><use><3>	Determining Direction With Magnetic or Electronic Devices  1. Find your direction with a compass. Day or night, using a compass, GPS, or cell phone equipped with either is the best and easiest way to determine directions. These devices are also the most accurate, making them the most reliable methods. A compass is a round instrument with all the cardinal directions printed on it. A rotating needle uses the Earth’s magnetic field to determine what direction the compass is facing. But, it’s important to note that when your compass points north, for instance, it’s pointing you in the direction of magnetic north, which is different from true north (the same goes for magnetic south versus true south). * As you spin around in different directions, the compass needle will spin as well, indicating which direction you are facing. * A compass will give false readings around metal objects like keys, watches, and belt buckles. The same is true for magnetic objects, such as certain rocks or power lines. 2. Make a compass of your own. If you find you are lost and don't have a working compass, GPS, or cell phone, you can make your own compass if you have a few items available. Be aware that this method isn't nearly as accurate or reliable as using a real compass, and it will only tell you the north–south and east–west lines, but not the exact directions. You will need: a metal sewing needle and magnet, and a bowl or cup filled with water, as well as pliers, scissors, and a cork (or just a leaf). * Rub the needle against the magnet at least 12 times if you are using a weak magnet like a refrigerator magnet, or about five times if you have a stronger magnet. This will magnetize the needle. * Cut a one-quarter-inch disk of cork.	(If you don't have a cork, you can place the needle on a leaf.)

Realize that whatever you might be going through is temporary. Life is like the tides; you have your highs and your lows, but no situation is permanent. Things will get better at some point. The sun is always shining behind the clouds. 2. Realize that suffering is a state of mind. If you don't believe that you are suffering, you can't really suffer. Everything is based on your attitude, which brings us to: 3. Be Positive. Positive thinking is essential in living a successful life -- and when other people see a positive person, it encourages them to think in the same way, and thus make their lives better as well. Positive thinking helps you to escape the state of mind that is suffering, and attracts positive things into your life as well. 4. Find what it is that makes you feel unhappy, and do what you can to remove it from your life. Now obviously, if you're unhappy because you have to deal with something like a bully or a mean boss, this may not be easy or even in your control. In that case, you must simply say: "Oh, well." and move on with your life. 5. Be persistent and loyal but flexible; progress toward your next steps of your individual plan for success, toward the light: apply these character traits, to the ability to follow through toward completion (self-actualization), such as: never giving up nor dropping-out of a job, career, or education -- but graduate from tech school, college, etc. Being flexible can allow you to sometimes retreat or pause, find an open door, and go through it to a new employer, a new degree plan, taking new training or a fresh career focus -- then progress and persist there. 6. Realize that deadlines, responsibilities and injustices have replaced wild animals as stressors in modern times. You may respond to being accused of a mistake in your work, through tightened jaws saying, "I'm sorry. I'll take care of it." You endure the standoff. You are faced with such stressors all day, every day. Stress that in essence never shuts off, is potentially harmful in two ways: 1. Increased risk of heart disease, digestive disorders, ulcers and many other conditions from continual surges of stress hormone. 2.	Avoid the damaging effects of prolonged stress, by two basic ways:

Ask yourself what makes each one unique. Try imagining what yours would look like and how it would stand out. * Ask local business owners about their experience in the industry to get a feel for their day-to-day activities and how they succeed. 2. Decide which sector of tourism you would like to focus on. The most common sectors are travel agencies, transportation services, accommodations (hotels, motels, and rental houses), guided tours, and hospitality. Consider all of the information and research you have conducted before making your decision. * Find a sector that is underrepresented in your location. For example, if your town doesn't have a good restaurant to express its culture, consider being the first! 3. Focus on a specific niche in your chosen tourism sector.	If you think hospitality is your calling, decide on the type of foods and beverages that you want to provide to tourists.

Follow the celebrity on Twitter. Find the celebrity's Twitter handle by typing in the celebrity's name into Twitter's search bar. If nothing comes up, try looking on their website or portfolio for their Twitter Follow link. * If you see a blue icon with a white check mark next to a Twitter account, that means that Twitter has taken steps to verify the identity of that account. A verified account means that the celebrity in question owns that Twitter account. * Be wary of unverified Twitter accounts. It's easy to find pictures of a celebrity on the Internet to use as the avatar. Fans and other people may try to impersonate the celebrity for attention or for malicious spamming. 2. Pay attention to how the celebrity uses their Twitter. The more active they are on Twitter and the more personal their tweets are, the better your chances of getting them to engage with you. After considering the following questions, if it doesn't seem like your celebrity does much personal engagement on Twitter, you may want to consider moving on to another favorite celebrity. * How frequent are their tweets? * Do they frequently tweet themselves, or hire someone else to tweet on their behalf? * Do they post pictures and links in addition to text tweets, or do they do the bare minimum? * Do they post their personal thoughts, or just use their Twitter as a way to promote their business commercially? * Have they ever sent an @message to one of their fans and engaged in a conversation with them? *	Her tweets are personal enough that they probably come straight from her.

Do a free-association or stream of consciousness exercise. As you begin to develop a plan to manage your stress, it can feel like an overwhelming task. Before doing anything else, try a free-association or stream of consciousness exercise. This exercise involves not censoring your thoughts but rather writing them down as they happen. * For a very short amount of time (approximately 2 to 3 minutes), write out everything that is causing you stress. * Don't stop writing until your time is up. Doing it quickly helps you not to focus on each specific stressor, but rather just work on getting it all out onto paper. * Write any thoughts or feelings that surface about your stress or stress management as well. 2. Make a list. In order to manage your stress, you need to concretely identify what you are stressed about and where it's coming from. Review your free-association, and make a list of your the things that cause you stress. Try to not get overwhelmed with what is on the list, but rather use this as an exercise to get all of the stressors a bit more organized. Additionally, making lists can help you reduce anxiety and can assist in creativity. * Feel free to write it down with a traditional paper and pen, or consider typing your list on a spreadsheet to make it easier to move things around later, if needed. * Don't worry too much about the order at this time. 3. Define each stressor with as much detail as possible. As you look at your list, try to narrow any broader stressors down to specifics.	Breaking down the source of your stress into specifics will help you choose a more precise and effective solution.

Choose the plants you wish to grow from a cutting, e.g. rosemary, lavender, roses. Not all plants will grow from a cutting, but you might surprise yourself with what you can achieve. 2. Using sharp garden secateurs (pruners), snip off shoots from the plant. Choose reasonably new but mature growth from the parent plant. Cut at a 30 degree angle leaving your cutting with a point. The best size of the shoot varies between different plants, for some, small cuttings 8-12 cm long are best, for others (e.g. poplars, mulberries), larger cuttings (called 'truncheons') up to a metre or two long and 5-10 cm thick can work best. If in doubt, make the cuttings about 10-20 cm long. 3. Strip a half to two thirds of leaves from the cutting. 4. Treat the cutting. Place the cuttings in a weak mixture of water and a seaweed-based liquid fertilizer for a period of 3-4 hours (put under a single fluorescent light), and then dip the cut end in rooting hormone just before planting your cutting. 5. Start your cutting in sand, soil, or even just water. Some actually produce roots better in water than soil. Sand is a sort of compromise, but should be treated like water regarding fertilizer. 6. *When using water, make it a very dilute fertilizer mixture. Also make certain the plant does not get direct sunlight, as the intense UV rays are hard on the roots. Aside from how well it works, another reason to use water is that you can see what's happening. This is not only fun, but also allows you to know when the plant is ready, without having to worry about guessing whether roots have developed. Once roots finally start, the rate of their visible growth can be astonishing, even hour to hour. * If using soil, plant cuttings in a moist well prepared garden bed rich in organic material, with a pH around 5.5 - 6.0, but you can place them in pots with good potting mix. Space the cuttings so they are about as far apart from each other as the cuttings are long. 7.	Success rates can be anything between zero (some plants cannot be rooted from cuttings at all) and 90%.

Analyze your essay question or prompt. Carefully reading your prompt is the first step in the essay writing process. Make sure you clearly understand what your essay needs to accomplish. Circle or underline keywords, such as “analyze” or “compare and contrast.” * Note that an essay prompt’s keywords have distinct meanings. Analyze, for example, doesn’t mean to describe; it means to pull apart and examine something’s structure. * Suppose you have to analyze an argument. Your essay needs identify the argument's rhetorical elements, such as pathos (appeals to emotion) or logos (employing reason or logic). After breaking down the argument's structure, you'll then need to explain how the author uses these devices to make their case. 2. Research your subject matter. Once you understand your essay’s task, find credible sources on your topic. Examine primary sources, such as the poem you’re analyzing or letters written by the historical figure you’re discussing. Read what other scholars have argued, and identify how expert opinions on your topic vary. * Remember to check your sources’ credibility. If you’re writing about a former president, find the biography scholars consider most authoritative. Check the authoritative biography’s footnotes and references, which will help you track down more reputable sources. * You won't conduct thorough research if you’re writing an essay for a test. Instead, read the sources provided with the exam. For example, if a literature essay test requires you to analyze an excerpt, read the passage carefully. 3. Develop a succinct, arguable thesis. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with your topic, come up with an argument. Your thesis should be a concise sentence that tells readers what you plan to argue. Rather than vaguely generalize or state the obvious, an effective thesis makes a clear, defensible, and specific claim. * For instance, “Schools should implement mandatory uniforms because they reduce disciplinary issues, help students focus on learning, and promote school spirit,” is clear and specific. * The thesis, “Mandatory uniforms are beneficial, so schools should implement them,” makes a claim, but “beneficial” is vague. It doesn’t convey why uniforms are good, so it’s not a strong thesis. 4. Create an outline to map out your essay’s structure. The basic parts of an essay are an introduction, the body, and a conclusion. A good essay is well-organized, and each part transitions smoothly and logically to the next. To begin your outline, write the Roman number I., label it “Introduction” then, on the line below, write your thesis statement. * For the next Roman numerals, write the subtopics, citations, and other details that you’ll cover in each body paragraph. * In the following example, Roman number II. would be an essay section, and letters A. through D. are body paragraphs that each focus on a sub-topic:II. Uniforms reduce disciplinary issues&emsp; A. 44% decrease in detentions after introducing uniforms (Smith, 2017)&emsp; B. Suspension decreased by 60% (Smith, 2017)&emsp; C. Absenteeism and tardiness decreased (Pew, 2013)&emsp; D. 66% of students report less bullying (Ohio Board of Education, 2016) 5. Use the TEEL strategy to organize your paragraphs. TEEL stands for Topic sentence, Explain, Evidence or example, and Link, or refer to the essay’s main idea. If your sentences are logically connected, your argument will be clearer and more convincing. For example: * Topic sentence: School uniforms may reduce the number of serious behavioral problems. * Explain: Evidence suggests dressing alike lowers peer pressure, promotes discipline, and prevents the display of controversial or offensive imagery. * Evidence: For example, according to the Ohio Board of Education, schools that introduced uniforms reported 44% fewer disciplinary referrals, such as detentions and suspensions. Furthermore, 66% of surveyed students said they witnessed fewer bullying incidents after they started wearing uniforms. * Link: These findings suggest that implementing uniforms is an effective way to foster a disciplined school environment. 6. Address a counterargument to strengthen your claim. Mention an argument that opposes your thesis, then explain why it’s incorrect. Be sure to bring up a strong counterargument.	.

Start immediately. Each moment of every day you have the opportunity to create change in your life. Making the decision to help yourself starts as simple as that – you decide. Your reasons for delaying are likely linked to fear and uncertainty. Starting your journey will help melt away both and move you toward improved health. * Mark today on your calendar as the day you decided to change your behaviors and live a more healthy life. 2. Educate yourself about eating disorders. Eating disorders include but are not limited to: anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorders, bulimia nervosa, pica, rumination and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. When learning about these conditions you might recognize some of your own behaviors. This can be a normal response, but you must be cautious to not self-diagnose to the point of upsetting yourself. Leave an official diagnosis to the professionals trained to do so. * Other eating disorders might have behavioral variations such as: anorexia where weight is not below normal; binging and purging that occurs on an infrequent basis; night eating syndrome where you eat excessive amounts of food at night; only eating certain foods; eating things that are not considered food like chalk; rumination disorder that involves eating food then regurgitating it into your mouth and chewing it again. 3. Address your symptoms and eating habits. Symptoms vary from one type of eating disorder to another and from person to person. While you may think you show all the symptoms of an eating disorder, keep in mind that it is the degree to which you experience symptoms that matters. For example, if you go on a well-planned healthy diet that requires you to restrict your caloric intake, it is not the same as restricting your food intake to an unhealthy level that endangers your life. * Anorexia nervosa symptoms include but are not limited to: being overly focused on body image; eating minimal amounts of food that results in a weight that is too low for your body size; and a refusal to acknowledge there is a problem. * Binge eating disorder symptoms include but are not limited to: eating mass quantities of food and feeling out of control; eating large amounts when you are not hungry; or eating large amounts of food in private because you are ashamed of your behavior. * Bulimia Nervosa symptoms include but are not limited to: consuming large quantities of food and relieving your body of it by making yourself vomit or abusing laxatives; using these methods to control your weight; feeling out of control; being overly focused on your body image. 4. Identify the root cause of your behaviors. Through introspection and observing your thoughts, feelings and behaviors, you can arrive at a better understanding or yourself and your condition. Asking yourself key questions will help you determine why you act the way that you do. * Ask yourself if you feel inadequate or suffer from low self-esteem? Do you feel depressed, anxious, angry, stressed or lonely? Does it seem that you have little control in your life? * Are you having problems with personal relationships? Do others tease you about your weight? Is there a history of sexual or physical abuse in your background? Do you have a hard time expressing your emotions and feelings? * Social pressure can greatly affect your feelings about food. Men and women are portrayed in advertising for the sole purpose of increasing sales of a product. They are portrayals of men and woman cast in a highly-stylized manner that is heavily airbrushed and manipulated to create an unattainable “ideal.” Are you holding yourself up to this impossible standard? Give yourself a break. * Are you using food to address any or all of these issues? For example, if it seems you have no control over your life due to a family or relationship situation, you control your food intake because that is the one thing you can control. 5. Improve your coping skills. Are you effectively managing difficult situations? If not, it might be time to improve your coping skills. If you are using food to cope with difficult situations, there are alternative you can use. Are you binging to create comfort, or purging to punish yourself? You are using food as a coping mechanism. * Take the time to develop key traits like compassion, grace, determination, and creativity as these have been found to change your brain so you can respond to difficult situations in a more positive fashion. For example, if helping others brings you comfort, reach out to others to help instead of reaching for food. * Looking to others for support and rehearsing responses to difficult situations are two forms of effective coping responses you can use. 6. Identify your emotional triggers. What are your emotional triggers that result in unhealthy eating? Determine what situations create anxiety, fear, dread, stress and generally unpleasant feelings. When a negative emotion is triggered, substitute the unhealthy behavior with non-food related behavior. * Find something that will hold your focus and appeal to the emotional needs your eating disorder attempts to meet.	.

Take a shower with shampoo and conditioner. Getting your hair nice and moist is the first step to achieving the wet look. Shampoo clears out the debris, while conditioner gives your hair volume. You can use whatever shampoo and conditioner you already have in your shower. 2. Pat your hair mostly dry. Touch a towel to your head to start removing moisture. To use mousse and gel properly, your hair has to remain pliable. It shouldn’t be sopping wet, but stop before it dries. 3. Squeeze a dollop of mousse into your fingers. When using product, less is more. Start out with a pea-sized amount on your fingers. You can get more later if you need it. If you use too much now, you’ll have a harder time making your hair look normal. * Hair gel can also be used here. It’s cheaper, but gels with alcohol in them dry out your hair more than mousse does. 4. Massage the mousse into your hair. Your fingers are your best tool for working in the mousse. Use your fingertips to move the mousse all the way down to your roots. If you’re having a hard time, try using a comb to spread the product. When finished, the mousse should completely coat your hair. 5. Style your hair with a comb. Run a comb through your hair to style it into the general shape that you want. You can also use your fingers for more intricate look. Mousse products give you a wide variety of stylistic options, so pick the one that looks best on you. * The mousse and comb combo creates a voluminous but wet look in any style you choose.	.

Take the luxury car for a drive and tap the music notes. By the end of the drive you could be almost $200 richer. You might even get an LP if you are really lucky. * Buy the bone for 2LP for your dog, it will get you Simoleons and LP faster. * If you know you're going to be gone for a certain amount of time, for examples, you were going to bed or school, have all of your adult sims plant for however long that takes. Make sure they are inspired because they'll earn 1.5X the simoleons. Have babies sleep, and have toddlers and preteens watch a movie marathon. * Sims that perform a long task while you are asleep will have the same amount of health when you wake up. If you leave a character doing nothing at night, their stats will have significantly dropped in the morning. * Don't waste time "whoo-hoo"ing: it only earns you as many XPs as dancing. So just select the "be romantic" button. * Get two ovens. If you are in the middle of baking something that takes a long time, and you need money fast, two ovens will help. Don't buy the expensive ones if you are not too rich though, because it doesn't let you bake any faster. * Don't waste your money on anything you won't use. * On the town map where you collect the town revenue, tap the Simoleons or XP very quickly. You can get up to six times the original amount. *	If you clean up the vomit, you can earn points. Doing this too often might make your device freeze up, so use it sparingly.

Hollow out a book if you'd like to hide your diary on a bookshelf. By disguising your diary inside of a book, it will blend into the rest of the books on your shelf. Choose an old book that you no longer want, then brush Mod Podge along the edges of at least half the pages to glue them together. Using a box cutter, cut a rectangle out of the pages inside that’s big enough to hold your diary.center * You can also buy a used book from a bookstore if you don’t want to ruin any of the ones you already own. * There are a lot of videos and tutorials online on how to make a hollowed-out book that you can follow along with. * To make sure your diary isn’t discovered, pick a book that you know your parents or siblings won’t want to borrow or read. 2. Put your diary in an empty container if you want a creative hiding spot. Your room is likely full of possible things to hide your diary in that no one would ever suspect. For example, place it inside an empty tissue box with a few tissues on top or put it in an empty shoebox in your closet on the top shelf.center * The trick is choosing a spot that no one else would look in. For instance, the bottom of your art supply box is great if you’re the only one who uses it, but not good if your sister borrows it sometimes. * Pick a container that completely camouflages your diary so you can’t see any part of it. Make sure that your diary doesn’t affect how the container looks, either. If the tissue box is bulging out from the size of the book, for example, your siblings may suspect something is hiding inside. 3. Place it under clothes in a drawer if no one ever looks in your dresser.	Set your diary at the very bottom of the drawer, then pile your clothes on top so it’s completely hidden.
Get_Your_Puppy_to_Stop_Biting.txt	### Method 1: Teaching Bite Inhibition	Ignore the puppy for 20 seconds .	### Teaching Bite Inhibition	Then ignore the puppy for 20 seconds .	<insert><Then><1>|||<replace><Ignore><1><ignore><2>	Method 1: Teaching Bite Inhibition  1. Play with your puppy using your hands until your puppy bites you harder than acceptable. When he does, give out a high-pitched yelp, imitating the yelp of a dog. Stop playing for a little bit. * Young puppies often do not know how hard they are biting, and so they bite playfully without understanding how sensitive humans or dogs can be. Puppies usually learn that they're biting hard by playing with other puppies. Puppies will nip and bite each other playfully until one puppy is nipped too hard and gives out a high-pitched yelp. The victim will stop playing, and the puppy who bit the victim is taken aback and also stops playing momentarily. Pretty soon, both puppies are at it again, playing and wrestling around with one another. If one puppy happens to bite another too hard, the same thing happens and both puppies tend to withdraw for a bit. This feedback loop teaches the offending puppy that his bites can actually hurt other puppies (and people), evidence that the puppy uses to modify his behavior. 2. If your puppy licks you or tries to comfort you, praise him and/or give him a treat. If you are clicking training the puppy, click as soon as he withdraws his mouth from your hand or lets up the pressure. * When your puppy bites you, let your hands or limbs go limp. Jerking your hands back in pain, while certainly a natural response, may actually encourage your puppy to play harder and continue biting. A limp hand, on the other hand, is very little fun to play with. * Go back to playing with your hands. If he starts to bite harder again, let out your yelp or stern rebuke and withdraw from playing again. * Repeat these steps no more than 3 times in any 15-minute period. Overdoing things won't send a clear message and won't learn to stop biting and will just continue. 3. Try using time-outs if your puppy doesn't respond to yelping or rebuking. Time-outs may be necessary if yelping doesn't work alone. When your puppy bites you harder than expected, yelp loudly and remove your hand to signal that playing has stopped.	If the puppy keeps on biting you, get up and leave for 20 seconds.

Invest in bear-proof garbage cans. Although they can cost between $150 and $300, the special bear locks will keep you from providing bears with an additional food source. Keep your garbage cans locked inside until garbage day to reduce the odor. * One study showed that human trash accounts for 70 percent of human-bear conflicts. 2. Cut down your fruit trees. They are a food source, and bears may come from up to away to enjoy them. If you want to keep fruit trees, pick them before they are ripe or just after they ripen. * If your town is near a bear habitat and has a lot of fruit trees, organize an event to encourage people to pick their fruit. Removing the temptation for them to eat off neighbors’ trees will also keep them further away from you. 3. Remove bird feeders. Bears are omnivorous and enjoy seeds. Black bears are good at climbing, so hanging them high on your trees does not remove the risk of a food-seeking visit. * If you still want to hang bird feeders, keep them at least off the ground and six feet from all trees. 4. Clean your barbecue after each use. The meat drippings at the bottom will be especially attractive. 5. Leave a radio talk show on when you are away. Keep it on in your yard. Bears prefer to steer clear of humans and radio noise can tell them another large animal is in the area. 6. Install electric fences around beehives and livestock pens. Although they will need to be more hungry and desperate to attack these food sources near human habitation, they do pose a risk. 7. Use ammonia and bleach to clean garbage cans and around your house. They don’t like the smell of these products.	.

Give_Yourself_Insulin.txt	### Using Other Methods to Administer Insulin	Insulin jet injectors use strong air pressure , or blasts of air , to spray the insulin through your skin .	### Using Other Methods to Administer Insulin	Instead , insulin jet injectors use strong air pressure , or blasts of air , to spray the insulin through your skin .	<insert><Instead><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Insulin><1><insulin><3>	Using Other Methods to Administer Insulin  1. Consider using an insulin pump. Insulin pumps consist of a small catheter inserted under your skin that is attached to a pump device unit that holds, and delivers your insulin through the catheter. Using pumps have both advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages to using an insulin pump include the following: * Pumps eliminate the need for insulin injections. * Insulin doses are more accurately delivered. * Pumps often improve the longer term management of diabetes as indicated by blood level measurements of your hemoglobin A1c. * Pumps provide constant insulin delivery in some cases which eliminates the swings in your blood glucose levels. * They make it easier to deliver an extra dose when needed. * People that use pumps have fewer hypoglycemic episodes. * Pumps allow more flexibility in when and what you eat, and allow you to exercise without the need to consume extra carbohydrates. 2. Recognize the disadvantages of insulin pumps. According to the American Diabetes Association, even though there are disadvantages to using an insulin pump, most people that use one agree that the positives outweigh the negatives. * Some disadvantages to using an insulin pump include the following: * Pumps are reported to cause weight gain. * Serious reactions including diabetic ketoacidosis can occur if the catheter unknowingly becomes dislodged, * Insulin pumps can be expensive. * Some people find it troubling to be connected to the device, which is usually worn on a belt or top of a skirt or pants, practically all the time. * Insulin pumps often require hospitalization for a day or more for the catheter to be inserted, and for you to be properly trained on how to use it. 3. Adjust to your pump. Using an insulin pump alters your daily routines. * Develop a routine to limit the time you turn it off, or take it off. * Have back-up pens or insulin vials and syringes available if the pump is not working properly. * Learn to account for extra carbohydrates consumed in order to adjust the dose delivered through your pump. * Keep good records of your blood glucose levels. Daily records with additional notes of exercise times and extra foods consumed are best. Some people record information three days each week, spread out through the week, to provide a good balance of information. * Your doctor will use your logs to adjust your insulin dosing and improve the overall care of your condition. 4. Ask your doctor about a jet injector. Insulin jet injectors do not use needles to get the insulin dose through the skin. *	.

Pick colors that you've loved almost all your life and that have been "in" for several years. * Use the color wheel as a reference. Colors next to each other go really well together, while colors directly across from one another contrast. Which means, if they're put together, they stand out and seem to vibrate. * Keep a theme in mind. You don't necessarily have to have a theme like the 80s or sports. Just think of what type of room you want to have. If you want a room that seems sweet and innocent paint your walls baby blue and store lots of white items. But if you want a funky feel to your room, use bright, vibrant colors like orange, lime green, and yellow. * For inspiration, look to your favorite object in your room. You could base your whole room off of that one thing. For example, if you treasure your green and black lava lamp, then you could paint the walls green and black or have a 70's theme. * Decide what walls are what color. Be sure to be leniant though. When you go paint shopping, you never know if you'll change your mind about your color scheme. 1. Measure the length and width of your room with measuring tape. Also measure the furniture you plan to put into your new room.	by 6 in. Do the same thing, except with your furniture. Label each paper with the appropriate name ex. bed, desk.

Find a gift that means something about the other person to you. Be proud of what you choose. Don't just buy something because it is in the bargain bin or because it was the most expensive item in the store. Put effort, care and consideration into the purchase or creation of the gift. Making the gift yourself is definitely an option too, and is even more a "piece of you", so feel free to do so. 2. Let it be a surprise. A gift prompted by persistent requests for it is not as exciting or fulfilling as a gift that is a total surprise. This does not mean that you cannot give things sorely needed by the recipient but how you will know this is by observing their life and knowing them, rather than heeding direct requests for items. 3. Think beyond stuff. Stuff is all very nice and cute when wrapped up but stuff ends up drowning us. Sometimes, giving stuff is giving a burden to another person and the "condition" involved in such a gift is that the recipient puts up with shelving your stuff in their already over-crowded life. If you are gifting the "person-who-has-everything", avoid stuff. Consider alternatives that won't oblige the condition of adding to clutter on the recipient, gifts such as: * A promise to visit monthly to take an elderly recipient to art galleries or botanical gardens; * A service - nappy (diaper) washing service, house-cleaning service, car-wash etc. * Plants for the garden that will produce food, scent, colour or shade * A voucher for a massage, spa treatment, fitness class 4. Think carefully about what the other person would not buy for themselves. If you give items that a person is already very adept at getting for themselves, muzzling in on this territory can be a means of invading it and substituting their sense of style with yours. Don't even bother; if you know the person well, you will know already what they do well enough without your help. Look instead for the things they'd never consider purchasing - like the red shoes with really high heels you overheard them pondering about but muttered that they couldn't afford, a trip to a spa resort that they would never think to slow down for normally, or a new food that is something they've never tried before etc. 5. Let the recipient know gently and without great "hoo-ha" that your gift can be returned to a store, re-gifted, or donated if it doesn't make them feel comfortable or happy. You do not want to create a noose around their necks. If you ever had an experience growing up when someone in your family gave your family something hideous and it was ferreted out each time this person visited, you will know that the sense of obligation can turn gift-receiving into a burden rather than a delight. 6. Avoid giving "useful" items that the whole household needs and will make use of. The toaster for mother on Mother's Day, the car-cleaning gear for dad... These things do service for everyone and are not gifts in the usual sense.	These sorts of items are just too impersonal to be true gifts and this makes them conditional--you are giving something provided that everyone else gets to use it.

Appreciate that breastfed babies have less offensive smelling stools, suffer from less bouts of constipation and are less likely to end up with diaper rash than formula fed babies. This is because breast milk is much easier for baby to digest. 2. Welcome the ease of feeding your baby from the breast. It is always available without waiting for preparation. No need to get up to prepare a bottle or heat the formula before offering it to your baby. 3. Think of the expense you will save by not having to purchase bottles, refill bags, replacement nipples, bottle cleaners or the many cases of formula it will take to feed our baby if you are not breast feeding. 4. Consider your post-pregnancy weight gain. Moms that breastfeed and eat a well-balanced diet as they try to lose weight find it easier to shed pounds than mothers who bottle feed. Breastfeeding automatically burns calories every time you produce new milk, which equates to approximately 500 calories per day for the average nursing mother. 5. Value the unique bonding experience that breast feeding offers a mother and her baby. Take the time to relax and get to know your baby in a way that no other person can. 6. Relish the thought of fewer trips to the pediatrician for a sick baby. Since breast fed babies tend to be healthier all the way around, you save time and money on visits, prescriptions and possible hospitalization costs. When breast fed babies do get sick they appear to get better quicker. In addition, the healthier your baby, the less time needed to take off of work. 7.	Think of all the trash you will not be contributing as waste.
Keep_Your_Dog_Happy.txt	### Enriching Your Dog's Mind	Always remember to take your pup 's personality into account so you know what his limits for socializing are .	### Enriching Your Dog's Mind	But always remember to take your pup 's personality into account so you know what his limits for socializing are .	<insert><But><1>|||<replace><Always><1><always><2>	Enriching Your Dog's Mind  1. Give your pup a job for when you're gone and he is left alone. Dogs are bred for a specific purpose, whether it be herding or hunting, and can misbehave when these natural instincts are suppressed. * Create an obstacle course in which your dog follows a scent to his favorite treats. * Provide him with food puzzle toys, like Kongs, to stimulate his mind. * Leave him with plenty of chew toys. These will not only strengthen his jaw and teeth, but also keep him from tearing up your shoes instead. * Hire a dog walker or someone to play with your pet while you’re away.  2. Establish yourself as pack leader and never waiver. It’s important to show dogs love and affection, but they are tribal animals above all else. Your pooch will become confused without structure and consistency in his life, so be sure you stick to your role. * Playtime is only for when he is calm and receptive. * Reward your pup with special treats when he has followed your directions. * During walks, your dog should be next to or behind you.  3. Remain calm and assertive around your dog. Never behave uneasy or anxious. Because you are the pack leader, these feelings are sure to rub off on your pet. * Nervous animals are more likely to be aggressive.  4. Maintain your dog’s confidence. Believe it or not, your pup does have self-esteem and there are things that you, as his owner, can do to keep it up. Praise your dog when he has mastered a new trick, along with other accomplishments. * Remember that your tone of voice is the key to communication with your pet; praise for him should sound different than a command  5. Socialize your furry friend. Keeping him isolated or at home all day can be detrimental to his emotional well-being and create fear when he finally does come in contact with other people or dogs. Take your dog on a walk, to the dog park, or let a friend care for him once a week. *	.

Smell good. Body odor is not good. Shower, and if you want, apply some scent. Use only a little. You want her to wonder what that wonderful smell is, not feel like she's getting hit over the head with it. 2. Talk respectfully to and in front of her. Guys who swear and curse loudly are not impressive. 3. Sound intelligent every once in a while, but don't be afraid to joke sometimes. A deep voice is great, especially when you're on the phone. 4. Be confident, but don't be arrogant. Confidence is great, and if you make her laugh too you'll have a winning combination. 5. Shave. Bristles are not good. Take care of your skin. It makes you look clean and neat, not rough around the edges. Sweet girls tend to prefer well groomed guys, not ones who are a bit of a mess. Alternatively, some girls like the wild just-got-out-of-bed look. Discover which appeals to your girlfriend and strive for that. 6. Show your interest. Ask about her favorite movie, food, flowers, books, everything. After you've asked her simple things, get to know her on a deeper level. This will show her that you're genuinely intrigued in her. Don't forget that being sweet isn't her only attribute. (But don't be too pushy or aggressive. Keep sexual questions out of the conversation, as well as anything too controversial, like religion and politics.) Do not reveal to her about your past and other current dates with other women too soon; do not chase other women for sweetheart before her such as letting your eyes wander to check out the other girls there. 7. Be yourself. No matter how sweet the girl is, don't fake it. Once you have her you'll want her to like you for who you are. Girls have differing tastes just like guys do. Don't fake the "bad boy" or any other archetype just be sincere and comfortable in your own self. 8. Don't be obsessive or needy. If she's acting like she needs some space, step back and give it to her. Take it easy, do not force excessive interaction; give your self some pride and dignity by not trying to hard to get her as sweetheart by not telling too much information too soon.	.

Use the net to get the fish into the bucket. * Handle the fish as little as possible until you’re ready to gut it. * Add additional fish to the same bucket. Make sure that the trout all have room to swim. 2. Humanely kill the trout. Cut off the trout’s head when you’re ready to gut the fish. * Do this at home right before you want to gut it. * Lay the trout flat on a cutting board. Hold the fish with your left hand and cut with the right. * Cut the head off in one swift motion with a sharp knife. * Throw the head away when you’re done. * Don’t hurt the trout any more than you need to. Torturing animals is needlessly cruel. 3. Scale the trout. Continue to use the same cutting board. * Hold the tail with one hand. *	Start at the tail and end at the head.
Handle_a_Friend_Wearing_Adult_Diapers.txt	## Section::::In public view.	Starting a long trip with no access to restrooms	### First conversation	Before starting a long trip with no access to restrooms	<insert><Before><1>|||<replace><Starting><1><starting><2>	Assuming you have had a talk with your friend, here are some situations where your friend might appreciate your help.  1. Diaper showing.Like underwear diapers have a tendency to show in the lower back after bending down to pick something up or stretching. This is enhanced by diapers having a higher waist and a plastic backing making it easy for shirts to slide up and uncover the diaper. Your friend most likely will not be aware of the diaper showing, and just like a Laundry Instruction Tag showing it is considered polite to tell your friend, so the wardrobe malfunction can be adjusted. * Consider making a codeword. Your friend might appreciate if you don't say "Your diaper is showing" out loud, you may agree on another more inconspicuous word like Socks. * Diapers can be tugged in. The top of diapers is plastic helping to seal in the urine while lying down. This part can be tugged inside the diaper to lessen the hight and look better, but it creates skin contact with the plastic which can cause itching and skin irritation. To decrease the hight it is better to bend this top part outwards letting trousers, pantyhose or other clothing keep it in place. 2. Offer to carry your friend's diaper bag. It can be annoying always having to carry a bag with spare diapers, wet wipes and ointment, especially as a guy. Offering to carry their bag eases not only the physical but also the psychological burden of carrying diapers. Your friend might say no, but it at least is a nice gesture showing acceptance and willingness to help out. 3. Making your friend aware that their diaper needs a change. * There is a difference between wet and needing a change.Adult diapers are made to be worn comfortably for several hours, typically 1-3 hours for the thin ones and up to 10-14 hours for the thickest ones. This mean that there is a difference between a diaper being wet and when it needs to get changed.A change is advised when: * It is in danger of leaking (soaked) * It smells (plastic pants can limit smell) *	.
Get_Rid_of_Bees.txt	## Tips	When a bee stings , it leaves a detectable scent marker that attracts more bees to sting .	## Tips	However , when a bee stings , it leaves a detectable scent marker that attracts more bees to sting .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><When><1><when><3>	Tips  * When a bee stings it dies moments later, except for the queen bee. A bee will only sting if it's the last thing it can do. * If there are a myriad of bees covering almost an entire tree with a loud buzzing, you should not mess with them. They are not aggressive in this state and are simply gathering food. When the pollen is used up, they will move on. The solution here is prevention; keep the tree trimmed so there are less blossoms to attract bees next time. * The cost of buying the necessary equipment and the time it takes to learn how to do bee removal properly are prohibitive, not to mention the lessons learned along the way (i.e. stings). At best they are painful, at worst deadly. It really isn't worth the risk. Call a professional. * Hives in walls or roofs often create the biggest problems. These beehives will typically contain anywhere from 20 to 80 pounds of honeycomb. Call a professional if you know there have been bees in your wall or roof for some time, or if you are completely unaware of how long they have been there. * If attacked, run! Getting into a building or car and closing the door is the best defense. If bees follow you into a car, they will immediately lose their desire to attack and will try to find a way out. Crack a window on the sunny side and they will walk up it and fly out. * Removal of bees as a non-professional is almost always a bad idea. If not done properly, the scent of the honeycomb will linger, attracting more bees and creating a recurring problem. This attempt to save money may end up costing you more in the long run. *	Once bees start stinging, they can become aggressive and the attack could quickly escalate.

Look for disrespectful behavior. A child with an attitude problem will probably disrespect your authority, or the authority of other adults like teachers. Watch out for small indicators of disrespect like eye-rolling and door-slamming, as well as bigger problems like talking back and breaking rules. 2. Notice how your child interacts with their friends. It’s normal for kids to squabble now and then, but if your child always has a hard time getting along with peers, that’s cause for concern. Stay on the alert for bullying behaviors like teasing and pushiness. In addition, notice whether your child struggles with social skills like sharing and compromise. * If you have an older child or teenager, pay attention to the way they talk about their friends, even if you don’t see many of their interactions. 3. Take your child’s age into consideration. A little rebellion is normal at some ages.	Teenagers might break the rules you set in an attempt to assert their individuality. These behaviors don’t mean you’re doing anything wrong as a parent.

Join an organization, club, or team sport to be around people who share a common interest with you. 2. Think positive thoughts. Be conscious of the way you think about your life and yourself. Identify negative thought patterns and try to replace these thoughts with more constructive ones. Occupy your mind with thoughts that are constructive and uplifting. Give yourself time to change how you think. It takes time to make these adjustments. 3. Set achievable goals. Create specific goals for yourself that you are likely to complete. Don’t make the goals too big or complex or beyond your capabilities. Completing your goals will help strengthen your sense of confidence, which is important when trying to get over depression. * Identify an area of your life that you want to work on or change. * Consider your past experiences with this topic or area. * Set a realistic standard you would like to achieve. * Set a realistic short-term goal for achieving this standard. * Make a realistic plan for achieving that goal. * Place this plan into action. * Keep an eye on your progress periodically. * Modify your goal and plan, if necessary. 4. Structure your days. Create a daily and weekly schedule for yourself. Write yourself notes as reminders. Center your schedule around positive events as much as possible. Schedule time for yourself after events that might be stressful or make you feel bad. Having a schedule will allow you to maintain focus and avoid situations that lead you into depression. As an example, break up your days into precise sections and note any differences between what you planned and what you actually did. Note how you felt during this time and anything that might have influenced your mood. * Early Morning * Late Morning * Early Afternoon * Late Afternoon * Evening * Night 5. Learn relaxation techniques. Engage in a form of meditation or stress-reduction technique.	Find a knowledgeable practitioner before you begin any of the following:

Approach a girl indirectly. This will allow you to engage her in a conversation without making it too obvious you are interested. There are so many opportunities to strike up a conversation if you just pay attention. If you notice she has a watch, you can ask her for the time. If you are at a mall, you can ask her where a certain store is. Then seize your chance to strike up a conversation with her. Since she is not probably expecting to get hit on, you will probably be able to talk more casually and she will too. 2. Compliment her, and really mean it. Her hair, outfit and shoes are perfect choices, because she will have put a lot of effort into deciding these things. She will appreciate when a man notices her efforts to look nice, especially a man she is interested in. 3. Be nice to her friends. If she is with a friend and you exclude the friend while chatting her up, she will feel guilty. She may leave you to go hang out with her friend, so be polite to her friends too and include them in the conversation.	You will not only seem generous, but also considerate.
Get_to_Sleep_on_Christmas_Eve.txt	## Steps	Drink hot chocolate after you are in your pajamas .	### Preparing for bedtime	Or , drink hot chocolate after you are in your pajamas .	<insert><Or><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Drink><1><drink><3>	Steps  1. Think of it as a normal night. Tell yourself tonight is not Christmas Eve. Do the same things you always do in your bedtime routine: brush your teeth, read a book, chat with your friends, etc. * A technique, that, strange as it sounds, works well is to play a quiet game you can play alone (or with another hyper and excited friend or sibling) is Mad Libs, while in bed. This will help calm you down and relive your built up giggles. 2. Wake yourself up earlier than usual on Christmas Eve morning. This will make you really tired! 3. Relax! If you are just jumping up and down and feeling hyperactive, you need to calm down; you're only feeding a build-up of excitement that it'll be hard to come down from. Read a book. Listen to music. Whatever makes you r-e-l-a-x. 4. Try taking a hot bath. Squirt bath toys at imaginary targets—anything to get yourself relaxed in the bath. Submerge yourself in bubbles and relax your muscles. Try scented bubbles and soap. Think about how, the more you can relax and feel like falling asleep, the sooner it will be Christmas Day! 5. Get into a comfortable sleeping position while in bed. Scrunch up really tight—as tight as you can. Hold that position for 30 seconds, then relax again. Try to stay still, don't move at all and you will become tired. This is important for anytime you try to get to sleep; but relax and close your eyes. See some of the related wikiHows in this article for some more ideas on helping you to fall asleep, or visit the whole category on Better Sleeping. 6. Count sheep. Any of these methodical, centering and calming methods will help to move you out of being too excited into a calmer state, which may help you to feel sleepy. Try focusing on each of the sheep as they jump over the fence. What do they look like? What type of fence are they jumping over? Focusing on these details will let your mind trail way from the idea of Christmas and will help you fall asleep. 7. Don't peek at the Christmas Tree! This might spoil any surprises and will keep you very excited and awake! Remember, Santa Claus knows when you are sleeping and when you are awake. He won't come if you are peeking! 8. Snuggle up with any pets. If the pet is big enough to fit in your bed (or wherever you are sleeping), try to fall asleep. It helps you to sleep when you have someone else in the room with you. It will make you fall asleep a bit faster. 9. Try exercising. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, exercise can help to calm you down. A couple hours before you go to bed, see how many push-ups, crunches, or jumping jacks you can do in your room. Exercise only for thirty minutes though; you don't want to stay up too late. Exercising is a great way to help you feel physically tired, so your body will want to sleep. Better still, it will take your mind off Christmas for a little while. 10. Lie in bed and say this in your head: "Relax my toes." (Wiggle them for a moment.) "Relax my arch. Relax my ankle. (Flex your ankle.)" It might sound corny but it really does work through the power of suggestion. Continue, working all the way up to your head. Even keeping up the effort of concentration on doing this is a great distraction from the night's excitement. You may not even get up to your head before you're snoozing away! 11. Drink warm milk or at least some eggnog. The milk provides calcium, magnesium, and L-tryptophan, which can help you sleep. You can also try hot herbal tea; it is very soothing and calming to drink. * When you're setting up a cookie plate for Santa is a great time to have some warm milk. 12. Read a book. It can be about Christmas, although it doesn't really matter. Try reading a school textbook... a really boring one, of your least favorite subject if you find it easy to fall asleep in class. Read a boring book to induce sleepiness; read an exciting one to get lost in and to help take away the urgency of thinking about Christmas things.Some good non-Christmas books are Harry Potter, Twilight, School of Fear, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. They are fairly long and can keep you occupied for a while. 13. Listen to slow Christmas music and think about the real reason why you celebrate Christmas. This seriously helps. * Make a playlist on your iPod "sleep songs." Soothing music will definitely help take your mind off Santa, and lull you to sleep. 14. Set a time to wake up. Make sure that the whole family agrees with it. That way, when it turns (for example 7:00) everyone is prepared to get up. If you get up earlier than this, have some breakfast, go to the washroom, get ready so that you actually look OK on video. * If you know you are going to be videotaped in the morning, prepare your best set of PJ's. You don't want everybody to remember you wearing that raggedy old t-shirt and a pair of shorts on Christmas morning, do you? Don't forget to brush your hair in the morning before galloping downstairs! 15. Don't sit at the computer, laptop, or iPad late at night, if you can't sleep; this will only keep you awake. The light actually fools your body into thinking it's not bedtime. * If you watch TV before bed, try to turn off or down all the other lights, so the room is darkened. That will get your body ready to sleep. 16. Burn a sweet scented candle for a little awhile (preferably lavender or jasmine) in a safe place in your room, extinguish it and lie very still with your eyes closed. The smell may relax you. 17.	This helps you relax and keep warm! Don't drink coffee. The caffeine in it can keep you awake.

Casually approach him and strike up a small conversation. Remember, shy people are just like everyone else except with a wall, like I said; they won't run away if you make quick movements. Small conversation is usually rather impersonal and can consist of: the homework, weather, teachers, something on the news, or otherwise. If he really likes you, he won't be able to stop thinking about you. * If you don't go to school with him, maybe ask what he likes to do other then homework, and school, or even maybe ask for his number. Remember if he doesn't text you first don't sweat it. If he's shy in person with you, he'll be shy everywhere with you! 2. Get in contact with him on a social network. It won't intimidate him as much and will give him a chance to think about his answer. If you don't have social media, just try asking for a simple number. 3. Attempt to talk to him a few times a week. By talking to him a few times a week, you will begin establishing a bond and he may start to tear down his wall for you. After small talk, you should begin moving onto personal things like family, travel, summer vacation plans, his hobbies, and other casual but personal topics. 4. Gauge his feelings and drop hints that you like him. After you've talked to him for awhile, transition conversations onto a more personal level. Perhaps talk about what you both are looking for in a person, and drop hints that what you're looking for is him. 5. Make physical contact after awhile, but be sure he's okay with it. Don't ask him if he's okay with being touched, just do it once and see how he reacts. A touch or pat on the shoulder is fine. If he seems to dislike it, then refrain from touching him until you know he is more comfortable with you. However, if he seems fine with it, then you should continue to do it every once in a while. Don't go too far; hugs (when needed), small touches on his arm, and pats on the shoulder are just fine. 6. Ask him out. Make sure to do this in private and one-on-one. Don't even ask around close friends, or else he might feel uncomfortable as well as feel pressured to say yes. You want him to say yes because he wants to, not because he thinks he needs to. He might also be pressured to say no, so be careful. 7. Keep the date simple if he agrees. Going out to public places is most likely not his thing. Suggest a movie at your house (though he might be afraid to meet your parents) or something else that's away from people. You could also suggest getting drive-through dinner and parking someplace quiet to eat and talk. 8. Every person has an ego. If necessary, find a way to increase his self-esteem. Make him feel confident around you. 9. Let him feel competent by having him help you with something. It could be a homework problem or where to buy the latest gadget. Whatever works. 10. Be genuinely interested in him. Ask open-ended questions about it. It will make you a good listener, get to know him better, and you will have fewer chances to say something stupid. (If you do anyway, as 99% of us do, forgive yourself.) 11. Be approachable and attractive, but not so stunning and loud as to draw him away. Most guys actually approach cute girls over gorgeous girls because they find really pretty girls out of their league. This applies particularly to shy guys, who have little confidence to begin with. I'm not saying it isn't okay to be really, really, really, incredibly good-looking. But don't draw so much attention to it. Now is not the time to try cutting-edge fashion or over-the-top makeup. 12.	Make it fun by trying some ice-breaking games and whatnot.

Cut cardboard into squares and put them in a bucket. Use a box cutter or utility knife to cut the box down to size. Aim to have about 10 pieces of cardboard in the end, but it’s okay if you have more or less. Place the cardboard pieces in a bucket. * Cardboard egg cartons would also work well for growing the mushrooms. 2. Boil water and pour it over the cardboard until it is completely saturated. Place a large pot or kettle on the stove until the water boils. Pour the hot water onto the cardboard until it’s completely wet through and covered. This helps kill any organisms that may contaminate your mushrooms. * Push the cardboard down to compact it and use less water. 3. Cover the bucket and let it cool for 8 hours. Put a lid on top of the bucket and let it soak overnight. The heat from the water would kill any mushroom spawn, so the water needs to rest until it is cool to the touch. 4.

Get_Into_Anime.txt	### Appreciating Anime	A particular anime might be your genre , the art style might turn you off .	### Appreciating Anime	While a particular anime might be your genre , the art style might turn you off .	<insert><While><1>|||<replace><A><1><a><2>	Appreciating Anime  1. Embrace the subtitles. Anime comes in two varieties, subbed and dubbed. Subtitled anime is generally thought to be superior, and most anime aficionados agree: The original Japanese voice actors are better to listen to than the western dubbed Anime voices, which can sound cartoonish and silly. If you don't mind doing a little reading, try and go for the subtitled option. * There's good and bad on both sides. It comes down to personal preference, not what others say after all. If you don't mind that the mouths and the sounds don't match up, go for the dubbed anime. 2. Get past the first couple of episodes. Anime is long-form story telling, which means you need to have some patience and wait a while before you make up your mind about whether or not you like something. If you're trying out a new series, watch a couple of episodes at least before you pass judgment. * The first episode for some series can be deceiving. The first episode of Elfin Lied has a naked woman and tons of gore but as it progresses there's far more to the story than just that. Don't worry: the characters eventually find their clothes. * On the other hand, a series can deceive you by drawing you in only to drag and bore. You'll find that really popular and commercialized anime are victims of this: Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, and Inuyasha. 3. Appreciate the artwork and the style. Anime is just as diverse as any variety of art or animation. Some of it looks hyper-realistic, while other styles are cartoonish and over-the-top, featuring talking Pandas and people with giant eyeballs. That's part of the fun. * Most anime features very angular people, and a hand-drawn approach, with a very light touch. Others feature really neon, eye-popping color.	80's Anime looks different from newer Anime thanks to unique and changing styles.

Carefully begin crushing your quartz. If you end up breaking off larger pieces that are only quartz, you can separate these out and focus only on the areas that have gold-colored particles. Crush these up until you have a dust of quartz and gold mixed together. 3. Obtain a gold pan and submerge your powders in water. Commercially produced gold pans can be found for about $10 or less online. Take your crushed powders and mix them with water in a large tub.	.

When you gutted the turkey, you set aside its innards in different bowls based on whether they could be cooked later or needed to be disposed of. * Gizzard * Heart * Liver * Neck, if you have it on your turkey, can also be cooked and served. 2. Store the giblets in the refrigerator or in the freezer. Depending on how quickly you plan to cook and serve the giblets, the freezer is likely the better option. * If you plan to cook the giblets within a day or two, then wrap them securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the refrigerator until you cook them. * If you want to save them longer term, wrap them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the freezer. It is also a good idea to put them inside a freezer-safe bag for extra protection, up to four months. * Be sure to get these items into the freezer before the “best by” date on the turkey's wrapping. 3.	It would be best to double-bag these parts in order to prevent leakage if the first bag rips. You should include all of the innards that you are not keeping to cook later, such as the lungs, intestines, and gallbladder.

Choose a dog toothpaste in a flavor your dachshund likes, to make the brushing experience more pleasant. Brush your dog’s teeth with the toothbrush in one hand while holding their lips back with the other hand. * Never use human toothpaste on your dog’s teeth, which is designed to be spat out. * Your dog will probably be uncomfortable having its teeth brushed.

Ask how you can help. When your loved one has a panic disorder, their needs will likely change depending on when you see them. When you spend time with your loved one, ask what they need from you in order to feel less panicked. * For example, you may say, "What can I do to help you feel more at ease?" or "What can we do to lessen any feelings of panic you have?" * Your loved one may not need anything but your company. However, if your loved one does need you to help when you are together, try to do the best you can to be sympathetic of their situation. 2. Encourage positive improvement. When your loved one has a panic disorder, there will be small, everyday things that they need to conquer. When you see small improvements in your loved one's behavior, let them know how well they are doing or encourage them to keep going. * People with panic disorders often develop phobias of events or places where they have had a panic attack. If your loved one works towards overcoming these phobias, give them positive encouragement. * For example, if your loved one typically avoids going to crowded places but goes with you to the mall, let them know how proud you are of them. You may say, "I'm proud that you conquered your fear and came to this place with me" or "You are so strong for coming to this place that causes a phobia for you." 3. Try to help set realistic goals. When you spend time with your loved one with a panic disorder, talk to them about setting realistic treatment goals. Your loved one shouldn't focus on being cured as the only outcome of treatment. This will only make your loved one feel discouraged when they do not get better immediately. * Help your loved one choose small milestones to reach for that are attainable so they won't get discouraged.	This will let your loved one know you care as well as help keep them on track with their treatment.

Then, begin walking forward and give your horse your walk command. Stop walking and make sure your horse follows suit. If it continues forward, step in front of it, hold up your hand, and say “Whoa.” * Your walk command can be something like making “smooching” sounds or saying, “Giddy up!” * This exercise trains the horse to follow your motion, which will help it respond better if you want to attach it to a cart and drive it. * If your horse doesn’t start walking with you, gently tug on its line to encourage it to walk. 2. Longe (or lunge) your horse using a line. Fit a halter onto your horse, then attach the longe line to the lowest halter ring on the front of the horse. Make your horse move to the left by creating some slack in the line, then gently tugging it to the left. At the same time, hold up your right hand and wave it around to get your horse’s attention. After your horse moves to the left, switch hands and repeat for the right side. * If waving doesn’t get your horse to move, you can smack your body to make a sound, which will get the horse’s attention. As an alternative, you can snap a whip in the air. However, never strike your horse. 3. Stop your horse by stepping in front of it and giving a command. Keep your horse's line in your hand so you have control. While your horse is walking, step out in front of it to block its path.	.

Pluck at the fibers with a pair of tweezers. You want the carpet fibers to stand up as straight as possible, which will make it easier to target the burnt pieces. Use the tweezers to brush the fibers back against the grain, pulling at them a bit to loosen them up. 2. Snip off the burnt top layer with a pair of scissors. Try to only cut the black or brown burnt part, not the lower, unaffected layer. Go slowly and be patient, as the carpet might be difficult to cut through at first. Continue pulling up the fibers as you cut to make sure you’re not missing any burnt pieces below the top layer. * You can use regular scissors or a smaller, sharper pair with a curved edge, like the kind often used for trimming hangnails. * Brush the burnt pieces off to the side and pick them up with a vacuum cleaner or by hand later. 3. Spray carpet stain remover on the remaining spot. Follow the instructions on the bottle and rub in the spray with a clean rag. Allow it to sit for as long as the bottle specifies. 4. Cut some fibers from another area and glue them over the area. If a mark or stain is still noticeable after you’ve cut off the black pieces, use the same sharp pair of scissors or a razor to snip off some fibers from an inconspicuous area of carpet, such as inside a closet or along a wall. Use a toothpick or a small, flat screwdriver to apply a bit of waterproof adhesive or glue to the new fibers and glue them onto the leftover fibers on the burned area. Let dry for at least 24 hours. *	.

Legally_Watch_TV_and_Movies_Online.txt	## Steps	Hulu pulls in shows and movies from several online sources , mostly the major networks and a few cable networks , too .	### Watching Ad Supported Programs	For example , Hulu pulls in shows and movies from several online sources , mostly the major networks and a few cable networks , too .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>	Steps  1. Watch on television network sites. All the major networks, plus several cable networks make many of their shows available to watch online via their own websites. There are a few catches. You may have to wait a day or two for a prime-time show to become available on the site, and you'll have to sit through a few commercials. But the pros far outweigh the cons. You can watch when you want to, or when it fits your schedule, and there are actually fewer commercials online than on TV. But don't wait too long because shows are usually only available for a short time after they've aired. 2. Try Netflix. You've probably seen on the news that movie rental companies like Blockbuster are going bankrupt and closing stores all over the country. That's because Netflix came along and completely changed the way people rent movies. It started out as a service that would allow you to sign up and rent DVDs that they ship to you at home—for free. There are no late fees, either, so you can keep the DVDs as long as you want. They still do that, but they've also added instant streaming to their service, so you can watch movies on your computer, or on your television through an approved device, without having to wait for the mail to arrive. There's a monthly fee, but for the price of one movie theater ticket, you can get one DVD per month, and watch as many streaming movies and TV shows as you want. That's a good deal. 3. Explore Hulu.	Hulu only makes five episodes of any TV show available at any given time, so if you miss one, you're out of luck. The site is free to use, but they also recently launched their Hulu Plus service where you can watch any episode of any TV show season they have available without worrying about expiration, and get access to other premium content as well. Either way, you still have to sit through some commercials, though.

Choose a material to work with. You can make paper bags out of just about any type of paper you want, including: brown kraft paper, patterned scrapbooking paper, and wrapping paper. Cardstock is not recommended, however, because it is too stiff.center * If the paper is not the right size, cut it down. Make sure that it's a rectangle. * For an extra-fancy gift bag, consider using fancy wrapping paper with either glittered or flocked designs. 2. Decorate plain paper. If you are working with plain, solid-colored paper, such as brown kraft paper, it would be a good idea to decorate it. This will make it look more like a gift bag and less like a paper sack. Get out some paint and stencils, and add some pretty designs onto it. Alternatively, you can add a simple pattern using rubber stamps and an ink pad or acrylic paint.center * For a fancier touch, draw your designs with glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto them before the glue dries. * Be sure to let the paper dry before moving on. 3. Fold the top edge down to create a seam. Orient the paper landscape style, with the designed or decorated part facing up. Fold the top, long edge down by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Run your fingernail along the crease to sharpen it.center * For a fancier touch, trim the edge with a pair of pinking shears first, before folding it. 4. Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you. The folded part should now be flat against your work surface. Make sure that it is still along the top edge of the paper.center * If you are using plain paper, with neither a front or back, skip this step. The folded edge will be on the inside. 5.	Overlap them by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If you'd like, you can run your fingernail along the side edges to make creases. If you'd like a more "oval" shaped bag, however, don't crease the sides. center

Steer clear of harmful substances. There are some substances that can make your atrial fibrillation worse and that contribute to an irregular heartbeat. Because of this, you should avoid the substances such as: * Salt, which can increase your blood pressure, which triggers AF * Caffeine * Tobacco * Alcohol, which trigger AF in some individuals * Cold and cough medications * Appetite suppressants * Psychotropic drugs used to treat certain mental illnesses * Antiarrhythmic in certain individuals, although they are used to treat arrhythmia as well * Beta-blockers for high blood pressure, unless cleared by your doctor * Street drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, “speed”, or methamphetamines 3. Manage your stress levels. High stress levels can increase your blood pressure, which can worsen your AF. High stress levels can also cause other heart diseases because it causes the constriction of your blood vessels. To reduce your stress levels: * Reduce your exposure to your stressors * Create a schedule for yourself * Take breaks throughout the day * Practice yoga * Set aside some time each day to meditate. 4. Eat a heart-healthy diet. There is not a specific diet that is for AF patients. However, your diet can be tailored to the underlying cause and prevention of AF as well as to lower the risk of stroke and heart attack. You can also create a diet that reduces the conditions that can make your AF worse. Eat more vegetables and fruit, avoid large portion sizes, and eat whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates, which include white breads, white rice, pastries, and dessert cakes. * A diet that is low in refined sugars can help to reduce your blood sugar levels and lower your chance of AF. * A diet that is low in fat, particularly saturated fat, can help to reduce your cholesterol, which contributes to heart issues. * A diet that is low in sodium can help to reduce your blood pressure, which lowers your risk of AF and other heart issues. 5. Quit smoking.	It also decreases the amount of oxygen in your blood, while the nicotine can do damage to your heart. It can also lead to many other heart problems, including coronary artery disease and stroke. If you are having a hard time quitting:

Begin with a short-sleeve, tan t-shirt. You’ll want to use a very large t-shirt, probably from the men’s section. * The t-shirt should come down to your mid to lower thighs, and it should be long enough to wear as a dress. * You can find inexpensive, plain cotton t-shirts in a variety of colors at stores like Target or Walmart. 2. Sketch a line along the top of your dress where you will cut it. You want to cut one entire sleeve and the neckline off at an angle. * With the sleeve that remains, you want to cut it to make it sleeveless. You’ll want to mark this part to be at least three inches wide, so it doesn’t break and so you can glue on your fringe. * You can use any kind of marker to make these lines. 3. Outline a triangular point at the bottom of the t-shirt. In the movie, this is the shape of Pocahontas’s dress. * Make sure not to cut this point too high on the sides so that the t-shirt still remains a dress-length that you are comfortable with. 4. Cut your dress along the lines you drew. You’ll want to use sharp fabric scissors. * As you cut, make sure that you are getting rid of the marker lines from your finished dress. * It’s fine if the edges are frayed because Pocahontas has a more rustic, natural look. 5. Measure the fringe for the dress. You should use a slightly lighter tan material than the color of your t-shirt. * Suede fabric looks great, but feel free to use any kind of fabric you want. You can find fabric at local hobby stores or repurpose an old blanket or shirt. * Measure the bottom and top perimeters of your dress, where you want to attach your fringe. This is how long you need your strips to be. * The strip should measure about 4 inches wide. 6. Cut your fringe. First, cut out the fringe strips by length and width according to your measurements. * After you have cut out your strips, make them into fringe. * To do this, simply cut in vertical lines upward from the bottom of the strip, spacing the cuts about half an inch apart. You also want to leave about half an inch uncut at the top of each strip. 7. Attach your strips. The fastest way to do this is with hot glue. *	.
Look_After_Your_Skin_in_Summer.txt	### Taking Other Measures to Protect Your Skin	Moisturize your skin while it 's still damp .	### Dealing with Summer Skin Conditions	Then , moisturize your skin while it 's still damp .	<insert><Then><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Moisturize><1><moisturize><3>	Taking Other Measures to Protect Your Skin  1. Stay out of the sun between 10am and 3pm. UV rays are the most intense at this time. The longer you're outside, the longer your skin is exposed to the radiation. Get your exercise and activities done in the earlier, less UV-intense, hours or later in the day.center * Some latitudes advise staying out of the sun between 11am and 4pm. Do your research before you go on vacation and err on the side of safety during the hours suggested. 2. Wear protective clothing over your skin. Cover up as much skin as you can, using lightweight fabrics when it's really hot and uncomfortable. Wear reflective colors, such as yellow or white to stay cool. Choose fabrics that won't itch, scratch, or overheat you.center 3. Wear a wide-brimmed hat. This will protect your scalp, face, and neck from too much exposure. Opt for a hat whose brim is at least wide. Make sure it's not too tight to avoid discomfort. If you're standing in one spot for a long time, tilt the brim as the angle of the sun shifts. 4. Wear sunglasses. The sensitive skin around your eyes is prone to fast aging. Worse, too much sun can raise your risk of ocular melanoma and cataracts. Choose sunglasses with strong UV protection. Select the color of your lenses based on your needs. For example, you should choose: * Gray for truest color correctness. * Brown for truest color contrast. * Yellow for enhanced depth perception. 5. Ditch the obsession with a tan. Sunbathing or using a tanning bed increases your chances of developing skin cancer. Moreover, sunbathing will add a good 20 years to your age by dehydrating and wrinkling your skin. Use mineral bronzer if you must have a tanned look.center * Be careful with fake tan. These products contain a lot of chemicals that can be harmful for your skin and your whole health. Check the EWG Skin Deep website for the safest products. * Dark skin is vulnerable to sun damage, too. Even though you may not be able to see the damage, it's still there. 6. Shower after swimming. Chlorine can dry out your skin and result in an allergic reaction. Even if you've been swimming in a natural body of water, hitting the post-swim shower will rinse harmful bacteria and irritants off of your skin. Use soap and shampoo as you would during a regular shower.center 7. Treat sunburn promptly. Cool your skin in a cold pool, natural body of water, or cold shower. Keep it short if you're outside to avoid more sun exposure.	Use aloe vera or other petroleum-free lotion. Take anti-inflammatory drugs like over-the-counter NSAIDs to reduce discomfort. Drink extra water to heal the burn and stay properly hydrated.

Learn_Japanese.txt	## Steps	Take a vacation or look for an opportunity to live in Japan .	## Steps	Finally , take a vacation or look for an opportunity to live in Japan .	<insert><Finally><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Take><1><take><3>	Steps  1. Consider why you are learning Japanese and select the method and financial investment that best reflects the results or purpose you wish to achieve. Everyone learns at their own pace, so accept the following as general recommendations and tailor to your individual needs. 2. If you are learning for fun because you like Japanese Manga (comics and animation) or for travel, get an audio learning CD. Just spending an hour a day, for example your commute to work in your car or loaded onto your portable music player during lunch and breaks, can build up grammar usage and teach you simple stock phrases and useful vocabulary. And you won't need to learn how to read or write any of it. You'll also have more fun on a short trip to Japan knowing a few useful phrases than wasting your preparation time cramming obscure Chinese characters into your brain. Your trip should be fun, so spend your prep time picking places to visit, referencing maps, and setting your itinerary. 3. If you are learning for business or you want to live in Japan, consider enrolling in a college level course, an intensive program or night school. Learning to read and write will be crucial to your success and having a mentor during the early stages is ideal for developing good study habits and asking all the questions you will have about Japanese language and culture. 4. Romaji is the "Romanization" of Japanese language. In other words, how to write Japanese using English letters. For example "Hoteru e ikimasu", I am going to the hotel. If you ask a Japanese person who can't speak English to write what they are saying in Romaji they will know what you mean. 5. Japanese has three writing systems. Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic alphabets, like A,B,C in English. Hiragana is used for native Japanese words. Katakana is commonly used for foreign loan words, like Makudonarudo (McDonald's). Kanji are Chinese characters the Japanese have modified and used for centuries. Begin studying all three writing styles early on if literacy is important for your purpose of learning the language. Kana (Hiragana and Katakana) can be learned in a few weeks and you can use them to write anything you want, all in Japanese. Kanji typically takes several years but is a great enhancement of your abilities. As you become more versed in Japanese, what you used to write in Kana you will begin to write more with Kanji. 6. Use flashcards to learn A) Vocabulary and simple phrases: They can be used while waiting for a meeting, on a train, etc. Some free cards can be found on the web to get you started, or you can buy higher quality cards at most college bookstores or online. B) Kanji: Look for cards that show stroke order (how to write the character) represented in the calligraphy of the vocabulary side and have example compound words on the definition (answer) side. 7. Purchase a good English-Japanese dictionary for your desk that is extensive for looking up anything you need to know. Also purchase a fun, pocket size dictionary that you can easily bring with you anywhere. Ideally it will be small enough to fit in a coat or even pants pocket that you can reference on the fly without taking a lot of time. If you are studying on your own you will need to buy a basic grammar book, otherwise use the grammar text provided by the course you enroll in. 8. If you can afford it, buy a handy electronic dictionary. On some you can look up kanji by hand writing them. However, these items can be more trouble than they are worth and a simple pocket dictionary can be much easier and faster. Use whatever you are most comfortable with. See the warnings below. 9. Find a Japanese person to pratice with. Lots of Japanese people want to learn English so it is possible to find many Japanese people who are willing to help you practice. 10. Join internet communities to practice whatever you learn. Train your ears to pick out what is being said. Even if you don't understand it, try to be able to repeat what was said so you can begin to pick it apart and develop comprehension. 11.	.

Preheat your oven to . Let your oven heat while you prepare the apples to speed up the whole process. Set a timer to let you know when the oven is ready. 2. Wash the apples. Run them under cold water until the water running off of them is completely clear. The water helps remove dirt and chemical residue. Once they are washed, pat them dry. 3. Peel the apple skins for a crispier chip. Use a vegetable peeler or paring knife to remove the skin. Start at the top of the apple and move the blade in a clockwise motion down and around the circumference of the apple. The skin should come off easily and in one big ribbon. * Keep your thumbs out of the way so you don’t cut yourself on the peeler or knife. 4. Core the apples with an apple peeler. Insert the corer tool in the center of the apple. To loosen the apple core, just push down and twist the tool. Then, use your hands to pull out the apple core. * You may not get all the apple core and seeds out. If there’s anything left behind, use a paring knife to gently scrape until the seeds fall off. 5. Cut the apples into thin, uniform slices. You want them all to be the same thickness. Slice horizontally, parallel to the stem, and aim for roughly thickness. A mandolin or meat slicer works best, but a knife works as well if you go slowly. 6. Place the apple slices on a metal cooling rack.	You need them to be exposed to properly air dry. However, it’s alright if the slices touch.

Make_a_Healthier_Hamburger.txt	### Making a Healthier Beef Hamburger	Remove the bun or ask for the burger on a bed of lettuce .	### Making Smart Choices When Dining Out	For example , remove the bun or ask for the burger on a bed of lettuce .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Remove><1><remove><4>	Making a Healthier Beef Hamburger  1. Choose lean ground beef. Lean ground beef has less than 10 grams of fat, 4.5 grams or less of saturated fat, and under 95 milligrams of cholesterol for a cooked three-ounce patty. Extra lean ground beef has less than five grams of fat and less than two of saturated fat. * Lean beef is labeled as 90/10 or 10%, and extra lean is labeled as 95/5 or 5% * Lean ground beef is rich in good protein, zinc, vitamin B-12, selenium, phosphorus, niacin, and iron. 2. Make smaller patties. Serving size is important when you make your hamburger. Some hamburgers can be six, eight, or even 16 ounces. No one needs a hamburger that large. You can enjoy a hamburger, but on a smaller, healthier scale. This saves you calories, fat, and cholesterol. When you make a hamburger, make your patties three to four ounces when raw. 3. Consider cooking the hamburger on the grill. Grilled hamburgers have a great flavor. However, grilling hamburgers can also help make the hamburger healthier. When you grill a burger, some of the fat drips out during the process. The hamburger can end up having less fat than you originally thought. * You can also cook burgers on griddle pans and the broiler. 4. Learn to cook leaner ground beef. Since leaner ground beef has less fat content, they can be harder to cook. However, you can still cook a delicious burger if you know how to cook these meats. For 90/10 beef, cook over medium heat. Cook on one side until the side is brown, then flip and cook the other side until brown. It usually takes 11 to 15 minutes to cook the burger. Just make sure to cook until the patty is done. * Coat the pan with cooking spray. This helps to keep the patties from sticking when you cook them. Heat the pan before you place the patty in the pan. * To help keep them juicy, avoid piercing the patties or pressing down on them in the pan. 5. Season the burgers to add flavor. If you find the lean meat lacking in flavor or juiciness, try adding seasonings and extras to the patties to add flavor without adding calories and fat. Season with salt, pepper, seasoning salt, paprika, dried herbs, barbeque sauce, steak sauce, and garlic salt. * Try mixing an egg white in with the patty. You can also add a ¼ cup of wheat bread crumbs. Or instead of bread crumbs, try a gluten-free option with almonds, walnuts, or other nuts. * Add things you’d traditionally place on top of the burger inside the patty. Mix in onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, salsas, or any other vegetables to make a tasty burger. Even try adding a small amount of low-fat cheese. 6. Blot the excess fat. After you cook the patties, remove them from the pan and place them on a paper towel. Use another paper towel to gently soak up the fat on the patty. This helps reduce the calories and fat. 7. Make smart choices when dining out. You can eat hamburgers when you go out to eat if you eat smart.	Ask for no mayo or for the condiments on the side. Skip the cheese and bacon. For restaurants that serve extremely large patties, share with a friend, or cut the burger in half and save part for a later meal.

Stick with your meds. It can be common for those with schizophrenia to stop taking their medication. You can use a few approaches to try to stick to using your medication in times when you feel like quitting : * Remind yourself that your medications treat, but tend not to cure, schizophrenia. This means for you to continue to feel better, you likely need to keep taking your medications. * Use any social support you have; tell your family or friends when you are feeling well to strongly encourage you to keep going on with your meds when you feel like stopping. * You could record yourself a message for your future self, telling you to keep going with your meds and why (they are a treatment not a cure) and have your family play it back to you when you feel like quitting. 2. Work on accepting your condition. Accepting your condition may help to make your recovery an easier experience. On the other hand, denying that something is wrong or thinking that your condition will just go away may lead to your condition actually getting worse. Because of this, it is important to begin your treatment and accept these two facts: * Yes, you have schizophrenia and it will be challenging to deal with. *	.

Locate a base branch and accessory branches in your yard or the park. Select a branch about long and wide so you can easily drill a screw into the base. In addition, look for smaller branches about long to use for your necklace hangers. Gather your branches and bring them home with you. * You want a main branch large enough to drill a screw into the bottom. 2. Squeeze a nickel-size amount of hot glue onto the center of your plaque. Let your hot glue gun warm up for 1-2 minutes, and pull the trigger to release the glue. Apply a dab of glue in the center of your wooden plaque about where you want the base of your necklace stand to begin. * It’s okay if you apply too much glue. You can dab it away with a paper towel, or cover it with paint later on. 3. Place the end of your branch in the glue and hold it for 30-60 seconds. After you apply glue to your plaque, hold your largest branch in the glue so it can set. Press down on the branch with moderate pressure, and release your grasp after about 1 minute. * Your branch should stay straight up on its own. If it does not, apply some more glue and hold your branch for another minute. 4. Drill a screw through both the plaque and the wood. When your hot glue is dry and your branch is secure, place a screw on the bottom of your wooden plaque directly underneath your branch. You can twist the screw into the wood a few times to keep it in place. Then, line your drill up with your screw, and gently pull the trigger. Drill the screw through both the wooden plaque and your tree branch. * Be sure to hold your branch firmly and keep an eye on your fingers to prevent any injury. * This adds supper to your branch, so it won’t fall over when you place your necklaces on the stand. 5. Glue additional branches to your main branch to fill your necklace stand.	Scatter the branches around your main branch to fill in the top. You can place the branches wherever you’d like, and you can use as many as you desire!

Lose_Your_Virginity_Without_Pain_(Girls).txt	### Before Having Sex	If you are on top of your partner , you can better control the speed and angle of penetration .	### Enjoying Yourself During Sex	For example , if you are on top of your partner , you can better control the speed and angle of penetration .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><4>	Before Having Sex  1. Make sure you feel confident in your decision to have sex. Most people fear the unknown, and it's easy to get anxious if you don't know what's coming. Feeling nervous is normal, but if you find you feel so anxious that your whole body tenses up when you think about it, or when you and your partner are fooling around, it might be a sign that you should wait a little longer, until you feel more excited than nervous. Instead of letting anxiety take over, try to find ways to relax and become educated beforehand so you feel confident in the moment. Here are some strategies to try:center * Read up! Knowing exactly what goes where, what's normal, and what to expect can help ease a lot of your anxiety about having sex for the first time. Planned Parenthood, Sex, Etc. and Scarleteen are good places to start. * Know your body. Understanding your own anatomy can help you feel more confident, especially if your partner is also a virgin. It's important to figure out what you enjoy, so you can communicate that to your partner and ensure that you both have a good experience. Masturbation can help with this, or you can simply resolve to be communicative while you experiment with your partner — whatever you choose, try to pay attention to how you respond to different touches. * Approach sex with a positive attitude. When you lose your virginity is a personal choice. If you feel extremely guilty and stressed out at the prospect, maybe it's better to wait. If you engage in sexual activity when it doesn't feel "right," this can impact your enjoyment of sex and may lead to feelings of guilt or shame. A lot of people grow up being taught sex is shameful, should be reserved for marriage, and is only to be experienced between a man and a woman. If you are struggling with these feelings, you may want to address them before having sex. It’s okay to have sexual desires and feelings, to be with other people sexually when it is consensual, to be attracted to any gender, or to be any gender. Sex should be a positive experience that brings you closer to a consenting partner. 2. Take a trip to the drugstore. Buying a few items ahead of time can make losing your virginity a little easier. Consider picking up:center * Condoms, which both help prevent pregnancy and help stop the spread of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Even if you're on another form of birth control and you trust your partner, using a condom can erase any doubts that might make you anxious in the moment. Don't worry about buying anything that's ribbed or extra tricked-out for your first time — your biggest concern is that the condom fit. Partners should consider going together and buying a few different types of condoms and trying them on and seeing what fits best so you'll be prepared when the big moment arrives. If your partner has a latex allergy, nitrile condoms are a great alternative. * Lubricant will ease a lot of the pain by reducing friction. If you're using latex condoms (which most are), do not use an oil-based lubricant, because they can weaken the latex and cause the condom to tear or break. Instead, opt for a silicone- or water-based lube. It is safe to use any type of lube with a nitrile or polyurethane condom. 3. Discuss your concerns with your partner. Having sex with someone you trust can make your first time a lot less nerve-wracking. Your partner should be considerate of your feelings, focused on making sure you have a good experience, and willing to help you through the process. If your potential partner pressures you too much, or if he or she doesn't seem very concerned about how having sex might affect you, maybe it's best to reconsider.center 4. Know what your hymen is. The hymen is a thin membrane that partially covers the vaginal opening, and almost every female is born with one. It starts to wear away over time due to a variety of activities, such as playing sports, tampon usage, menstruation or normal movement. Here's what you need to know about it as far as losing your virginity is concerned:center * You probably have a partial hymen. If you're a teenager, chances are that only part of your hymen is left — which is normal, particularly if you've already started having periods. If you want to investigate more, you should be able to see your hymen easily with the help of a flashlight and a hand mirror. * If you do bleed, it shouldn't be very much. Any bleeding you experience after losing your virginity should not be on the same level as having a period. Instead, it should only be light spotting for a few hours after. Some girls won't bleed at all. * Breaking your hymen shouldn't be overwhelmingly painful. Actually, if you do experience pain during your first time, it's probably from friction if you are not sufficiently lubricated or aroused — not because your hymen has nerve endings (spoiler: it doesn't). The good news is, although you can't control your hymen tearing, you can control how relaxed you are. * In some cases, your hymen may not break at all. It can stretch or the opening in the hymen may be large enough that the penis, sex toy, or fingers inserted do not tear the hymen. 5. Get acquainted with how your vagina is angled. If you can help your partner ease into you at the correct angle, you'll avoid some potentially painful fumbling. Most vaginas are at an angle and tilt forward, toward the belly. If you were standing, your vagina would be at a 45-degree angle to the floor.center * If you regularly use tampons, you're one step ahead. Take note of how you approach inserting a tampon, and try to recreate that same angle when you're starting to have penetrative sex. * Remember that missionary is not the only position you can use — another position, in which you have more control, may be more comfortable.	.

Act confident. Confidence is very sexy for some guys. People are attracted to those who are confident and sure of themselves. Be unashamed of exactly who you are. Feel free to be a little dorky, if that's part of your personality, and openly enjoy the things you enjoy.center * Remember to keep your confidence in check. Do not, say, be argumentative with others about your opinions, tastes, or ideas. Just feel free to state them without shame. 2. Be kind. If a guy sees you being kind to others, he'll know you're someone he wants to be around. Make sure to show compassion and love to those around you. This will increase the chance of a guy liking you.center * You do not have to do anything big to show kindness. Simple things can show that you're kind. Do things like be on time, be polite, and ask about other people's feelings. 3. Be open to new things. You want him to feel like he can be around you and still do the things that he enjoys. People tend to be drawn to people who are more agreeable, so do not balk at new ideas or new things. This may make a guy want you more.center * If the thing he enjoys are a bit unusual, he may really appreciate someone who shows genuine interest in them. For example, if he keeps odd collections, ask about them rather than raising an eyebrow. 4. Be positive. People in general are attracted to those who exude positivity. Find the happy coincidences in life, the upsides of tough situations, and the funny moments. A guy will want to be around that kind of energy.center * It can take some work to become a more positive thinker. Work on catching negative thoughts and redirecting them. For example, you may think, "I'm running late for work. This is awful!" Instead, think something like, "It's a good thing I'm rarely late, so this won't reflect poorly on me this one time." * If you make an effort to be positive during your day-to-day life, you're likely to come off as more positive to those around you. 5. Give him his space. A guy wants to feel like he's free to be himself, which requires some alone time. Respect that space. A good way to do so is to have your own interests and activities outside of him. Make it clear to him you have your own group of friends and your own hobbies and interests. If he sees you're more independent, he may want you more.center * For example, say he asks you to go out on a night you have plans with friends. If you cancel plans eagerly, he may worry that you won't give him space in a relationship. * Instead, say you already have plans, but immediately ask to reschedule. 6. Keep your conversations interesting. Don't let conversations get stagnant. If the conversation seems to be dying down, bow out or change the topic. You want to keep out the awkward small talk as much as possible.center * You can always default to asking about things he likes.	.

Organize_an_Essay.txt	### Organizing Your Essay	You might find that placing your least important argument at the beginning drains your essay of vitality .	### Revising the Plan	For example , you might find that placing your least important argument at the beginning drains your essay of vitality .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><You><1><you><4>	Organizing Your Essay  1. Write a thesis statement. Make this a unique observation, a powerful argument, an interpretation of a particular work or event, or another relevant statement that is not simply stating the obvious or summarizing a larger work. * Include the most salient points within your thesis statement. For example, your thesis may be about the similarity between 2 literary works. Describe the similarities in general terms within your thesis statement. * Revise your thesis statement. If in the course of writing your essay you discover important points that were not touched upon in your thesis, edit your thesis. 2. Create an outline of the points to include in your essay. Use your thesis statement to determine the trajectory of your outline. For example, if you will compare and contrast 2 different topics, outline the similarities and the differences. * Determine the order in which you will discuss the points. If planning to discuss 3 challenges of a particular management strategy, you might capture your reader's attention by discussing them in the order of most problematic to least. Or you might choose to build the intensity of your essay by starting with the smallest problem first. 3. Write topic sentences for each paragraph. A clear topic sentence will assist with essay organization. Devote each paragraph to discussing only the point of its topic sentence. Discussing tangential information will create a disorganized essay. * Ensure that your topic sentence is directly related to your main argument. Avoid statements that may be on the general topic, but not directly relevant to your thesis. 4. Use transitional words and sentences. Create coherence for your essay by using transitional words that connect each paragraph to the one before it. Beginning paragraphs with words such as "likewise" and "in contrast" will allow your reader to follow your train of thought. 5. Craft an effective conclusion. Include a restatement of your thesis using other words and summarize your essay's main points. To create a captivating conclusion, offer insights about the implications of your argument or findings for further thought or investigation. 6. Read the essay out loud to catch inconsistencies or choppiness. You may find that your essay abruptly changes direction or some of your paragraphs contain unnecessary sentences or information. 7. Edit the placement of the sentences and paragraphs. Sometimes an essay's organization is improved by simply changing the order of sentences or paragraphs.	Experiment with the order of the sentences and paragraphs for heightened effect.

Thickening spray can be used all over, like hairspray. 4. Blow dry your hair using your fingers to comb through it gently. You'll have to use a brush eventually. Try to use it as little as possible. 5. Starting at the bottom of your head, divide the hair into small sections for curling. Spray each section just before you curl it. Hold the curl in the barrel for about 10 seconds.	Do your entire head. Pin each curl in place before you move to a new section.

Choose an oil to apply. You can choose from many kinds of oils, including coconut, olive, castor, almond, jojoba, argan, tea tree, eucalyptus, lavender, or peppermint oil. If you choose an essential oil you can even mix it with a carrier oil, such as adding several drops of tea tree oil to a few tablespoons of almond oil. 2. Dab the oil on your scalp. You can use your fingers or a cotton ball to apply the oil to your scalp. You can coat your entire scalp or simply concentrate on the itchiest or driest areas. The oil is good for your hair, too, so you can coat your strands with the oil, if desired. 3. Massage the oil into your scalp. Use your fingers to gently massage the oil into your scalp using circular motions. Spend a few minutes massaging the oil in so that it penetrates the top layer of your skin. 4. Leave the oil on for one to twelve hours. If you have a very dry scalp, consider leaving the oil on overnight. Simply cover your hair with a shower cap or scarf if you are worried about getting the oil on your pillowcase. 5. Shampoo your hair and scalp to remove the oil. Choose a mild or moisturizing shampoo so that you don’t strip all the oil from your scalp, but simply remove the excess. 6. Condition the ends of your hair.	Avoid putting it on your scalp and the roots of your hair, as these areas are already moisturized by the oil.

Use this shyness as a Cue. Whatever inside you that triggers shyness is because we perceive it as a trigger for shyness. Its like computer programming when in a 'program' gets a certain type interrupt it behaves in the same way how we have programmed it to handle interrupts. Similarly our mind can be programmed too. Think a little deeper we were programmed since our childhood, to react to certain stimuli like stay away from strangers, heights, dangerous animals etc. However for certain stimuli our reactions are default, means we perceive them and react in a way which comes naturally to us (by default) and this reaction could be flawed. For example When people see a lizard some would it as an ugly reptile, while some would perceive it as a beautiful pet, this could be because of their natural(by default) reaction or response to the stimuli(lizard). In the same way when shy people see people(stimuli) your natural response is shyness. The truth is that you can change this response by re-programming your mind. Some ways this could be done by... * Questioning yourself and checking the validity of your reasons. For example . *	Try to see this shyness as a Cue to push yourself hard and to do the opposite of what you have been doing when you feel shy. When you feel shy in public you probably leave to another quiet place because this has been your default reaction for so long but this time when you feel shy, push yourself and do the opposite I.E talk to people. Yes you will feel extremely uncomfortable and negative but again see these emotions as a trigger to push yourself even harder. More the magnitude of these negative emotions, the harder they will motivate you to push yourself. After trying this for several times you will realize that these negative feelings and emotions were actually your good friends because they motivated you to push yourself even harder.

Make sure you have good quality flashlights and lamps with fresh batteries. You can also purchase self-powered flashlights and self-powered radios. Some models will also charge your cell phone. * Candles. In case your flashlight suddenly gives out or you run out of batteries, you can light your home the old-fashioned way. * Non-perishable food. Stock up on canned soups and vegetables, powdered food, and grains like rice and pasta. Make sure you have enough to last your family at least three or four days. Make sure you have a manual can-opener, as well. * Bottled water. If you're worried about the pipes freezing, stock up on some water. You can buy it bottled, or simply purchase a few gallon jugs and fill them from the tap. * Blankets and warm clothing. You may already have these items, but remember you will need enough blankets to keep you warm without any heat and in adverse conditions. Consider purchasing mittens, thick woolen socks, and a hooded sweatshirt, if you don't already own these items. * A camping stove or grill. A gas-powered camping stove is a wise investment for any emergency situation. If you have an electric stove in the kitchen a camp stove is almost a necessity. Be sure you use it with proper ventilation to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, and have plenty of backup fuel. * Matches to light your gas range/camping stove/candles. Do not rely on lighters that can run out of fuel or break down all too easily. * A battery operated radio. This way you can get news without wall power. Make sure the batteries are good. It is also possible to buy a motion charging radio, as you can with a flashlight. * Prescription medications. Like food, it is always wise to have enough to last you a few days. * A first aid kit. You never know what kind of injuries or emergencies will happen, so make sure you have sterile bandages, disinfectant, antibiotic ointment, and over-the-counter painkillers available. * A cellphone with a cord, or a portable cellphone charger.	Many states require at least one wall plugged phone, which receives power from the telephone connection, in all households.

Only use one flipper at a time. When you try to use both flippers, you’re more likely to miss the ball. Instead, look at the direction the ball is coming and only use the closest flipper. If the ball is on the left use the left flipper, and use the right flipper if the ball is falling down the right. * Use both flippers only if the ball is falling directly down the middle. Nudge the machine slightly to move the ball into safety. * Anticipate the ball’s movements instead of reacting to it. Reacting to the ball will only make you have less control. 2. Rest the ball on the flippers to slow the ball down. When the ball comes down, activate the nearest flipper and let the ball rest in the pocket made by the path and flipper. When you’re ready to shoot the ball, let the flipper fall so the ball rolls. * Activate the flippers slowly so you don’t accidentally hit the ball back up into the machine. * If you’re able to slow down and think about your next move, you’ll be able to make your balls last longer and get a higher score. 3. Learn where the ball goes with different parts of the flipper. After you’ve stopped the ball, try hitting it on different places with the flipper. Each part of the flipper will shoot the ball to a different area. Play the machine a few times to get an idea of where your ball goes. * Each pinball machine will play differently, even if they’re the same game. Take the first ball of each game to learn the machine and how it shoots. * When you use the left flipper to shoot for an area on the right side of the machine, it’s called a forehand hit.	.

This effort provides an opportunity for neighbors to meet and get to know each other, something that has become less common lately.	In addition to not being familiar with your neighbors, the dilemma is compounded by the fact that many adults in these neighborhoods work multiple jobs frequently with odd hours, making it extraordinarily difficult to schedule meetings and organize events. This environment also makes it challenging for neighbors to get to know and care about one another in a way that would encourage them to watch out for each other.

Use empty jars, margarine containers and ice cream tubs to store any buttons, threads, nails, screws and other odds and ends lying around your apartment. 2. Cut plastic milk bottles in half and use them for storage to keep puzzles, marbles and other small toys gathered together and up off your apartment floor. 3. Keep your kids’ backpacks in an easy-to-find location near the door, to reduce last-minute rushes when leaving the apartment. Backpack racks sell online for very little. 4. Donate clothes to charity if your kids have outgrown them or if you haven’t worn them in the last year. 5. Reduce paper clutter in the kitchen by hanging a bulletin board (or adding fridge magnets) on an unused wall in your apartment. 6. Donate or discard multiple kitchen items, or items you haven’t used in a year. 7. Buy a cheap wine rack in which to store your bathroom towels. You’ll be surprised to discover that rolled-up bathroom towels fit well in a wine rack, creating extra space in your cupboards. 8. Hang a rack in your shower to store soap, shampoos and conditioners. Make sure razors are kept out of reach of children and dogs or other pets. 9. Throw out expired medicines and old makeup. Expired medicines may in certain, limited cases, be ineffective and could be dangerous in your apartment, especially if your children discover them. Makeup which is past its best may not be good for your face.	.

Do your research. Take a walk in your neighborhood or a local park to find a scene with evergreen and shade trees. It doesn't have to be fancy, just raw material to be transformed as you work. Take a snapshot to keep the view in mind. 2. Use the internet if you don't have such trees in your vicinity. 3. Do a quick sketch. Even if it is from the window of your parked car or house. Simplify the scene. Sketch the tree masses or groupings in pencil on whatever paper you have handy. No need to worry about details at this point. 4. Take a really close look at the evergreens. While they are all mostly triangular in shape, the branches come out in various ways. Some are straigh, others droop and other arch upwards. 5. Make notes and sketches at the scene. Get down on paper how various trees actually look. 6. Sketch the needle clusters. The quality, shape, even color of evergreen needles vary. 7. Look closely at the deciduous trees to see how they grow. We often forget to really look how their trunks and branches grow and how unique each one is. Sketch a number of these trees. Look for varying heights, fullness and configuration of branches, etc. 8. Work out some trial compositions by doing thumbnail sketches. This is best done back at home in the comfort of a well lit and warm room. Do this work in a sketchbook. The paper is decent quality and the sketches will be kept in a safe place, all together. Thumbnails will allow you to quickly test out ideas. You will be getting closer to your final design as you work. 9. Play with values. Put dark shapes against light ones and vice versa. 10. Continue in your sketchbook to explore the three grounds of a piece of art. These are three divisions of space into thirds; foreground, middle ground and background. 11. Put things in the foreground, or closest to the viewer, in sharp focus. This is approximately how we see a scene. The shapes are distinct and colors clear and bright. 12. Move up your page to the middle ground or middle third. Here is where the "focal point" or "center of interest" will be located. This should fall slightly off center and be interesting enough to capture and hold the viewer's interest. 13. Think what the center of interest, or in this painting, the foothills, might contain. Hikers, mountain climbers readying for their ascent, people camping in tents or a cabin. Wild animals such as cougars, coyotes or mountain lions. Tame animals such as mules, sheep or goats. 14. Picturing a ski lodge might come to the athletically inclined. In the mountains, you might have a ski lift with ski trails winding down it. 15. Imagine water washing down the mountain.	.

Play_Blackjack.txt	### Playing Blackjack	To win , the player has to be closer to 21 than the dealer , without going over .	### For the True Beginner	In order to win , the player has to be closer to 21 than the dealer , without going over .	<insert><In><1>|||<insert><order><1>|||<replace><To><1><to><3>	Playing Blackjack  1. Understand the "House Rules". Most casinos always "stand" on 17 and greater. Some will "Hit" a "soft 17" (a 6 and an ace). Some casinos (though rarely) require an "ante" like in poker (Play in those casinos is favors the house as much as 20%). 2. Learn the value of the cards: * Number cards: The number is the value of the card. * Face Cards: The value of face cards is 10. * Ace: Either 1 or 11. It is counted as 11 unless it would put you over 21, in which case it counts as 1. 3. Learn your choices: The casino's greatest advantage is that the player has to act first. If a player "busts" (goes over 21), the casino immediately takes the players money. If the casino then "busts" on the same hand, the player still loses. The dealer is the last one to play the hand. * Hit: Get another card. * Stand: Keep your current cards and do nothing. * Insurance: A bet to break even, only available when the dealer is showing an ace. If the dealer has a blackjack, the insurance bet pays off 2-1 (you break even). * Double Down: You double your bet, and get only one more card. * Split: Make two hands from one hand, if both cards are the same value. If both of your hands win, you get double the amount of money. If only one wins, you break even. If both hands lose, you lose double the money. Split the hands by separating the cards and placing a duplicate bet. * Splitting can make good hands out of bad hands and bad hands out of good hands. Before splitting, always consider what the effect of splitting will likely be. * Surrender: In many casinos, you can (before playing and after determining if the dealer has a blackjack) choose to give up half of your bet without playing. Surrender is usually desirable when the dealer is showing a face card, and the player has a hand likely to bust. 4. Understand the implications of insurance, splitting,double down and surrender. * All of the extra actions favor the house: * When making an insurance bet, you are betting that the dealer's hole card is a 10, Jack, Queen or King. Their are 13 potential ranks of cards in the deck. You have less than a 1 and 3 chance of it paying. The best time to make an insurance bet is when you have a blackjack! If the dealer turns out to have a blackjack, you will have a "push" (tie) with the dealer; your insurance bet will pay 2-1 which would equal an average payout on a bet. * When doubling down, you only get one card. You may not like the hand you end up with. In fact, that is what the casino is counting on! Never double down if the dealer is an ace. Never double down if the dealer has a face card (unless you have 11). * Splitting can turn an excellent hand into a terrible one, and vice versa. Here are some rules of thumb: Never split 5's (Your total is 10. You are likely to end strong. Always split 7's, 8's and Aces. Splitting 7's and 8's will change probable losers to probable winners. Splitting Aces is advantageous, but understand this: You are only allowed to split Aces once, and you can only take one card for each new hand. The casinos required this because Splitting Aces, without the restriction, is a great advantage. * Once you have "surrendered" your hand, the dealer's actions are unimportant (to you). If the dealer's hand goes sour, you have already given up. 5.	If the player goes over, he has "busted". If it's a tie, its a "push", neither the player or the house wins. A blackjack is when your starting hand is an ace and 10, or face card.
Prevent_Heel_Lift_in_Hiking_Boots.txt	### Use Lacing Techniques	Bring the laces back together and tie them tightly .	### Using Proper Lacing Techniques	Then bring the laces back together and tie them tightly .	<insert><Then><1>|||<replace><Bring><1><bring><2>	Use Lacing Techniques  1. Use a surgeon's knot to isolate the lacing tension in various parts of your shoes. For example, if you want to keep the toe box loose and wide but you want to tighten the boot around your ankle, you would lace loosely around the top of your foot, use a surgeon's knot, then lace more tightly the rest of the way. To make a surgeon's knot: * Cross the laces. * Bring one lace over and under the "bridge" you just created. This is the simple knot everyone makes when tying their shoes. * Bring that same lace over and under the "bridge" again. This extra loop creates extra friction that locks in the tension. * Tighten by pulling the laces apart. 2. Use the heel lock technique to, well, lock your heel down. * Lace your shoes normally through the lacing holes. Stop before you get to the hooks (there are usually two on each side of a hiking boot, at the ankle portion). * Instead of diagonally crossing the laces, have them go straight up to the hooks. * From the hooks, cross the laces and bring them underneath the section that went straight from the lacing hole to the lacing hook. *	Pull and you will feel the pulley system you just created locking your heel into place.

Identify the topic of your speech. If it is up to you to select the topic, choose a subject that you know well and target it so that is appropriate for your audience. 2. Research your subject. If it is not a subject with which you are familiar, start with the most general background sources that you can find. Good examples include an encyclopedia, the internet or a newspaper such as the NY Times. 3. Know for how many minutes you have to speak. This is very important because you don't want to risk having too little or too much to say. You may also want to budget in time for questions at the end. Practice the speech after it is written, to get an idea of how much time it will take you to deliver it. 4. Know your audience. Discuss things that the audience might specifically be interested in. For example, if you are giving a speech to a group of plant enthusiasts at the Botanical Gardens, speak about plants, aromatic uses of plants, famous botanists or biodiversity etc. 5. Write a succinct, single-sentence statement about your subject. This is similar to a thesis statement for a written paper. This statement is the foundation for your speech. 6. Outline the rest of your speech on index cards as you would outline a paper. Do not write out the speech. The outline is there to trigger your memory, not to give you a script. There should be no more than 3 - 5 subtopics that support your main statement. Make sure you know enough about each subtopic to speak briefly on each one. 7. Use one card for the introduction. This will include your main statement (or some variation of it). Use one or two cards for each subtopic and one for the conclusion which refers back to the main statement. 8. Write brief sentence fragments or even single words. These words or fragments should be ones that remind you about what you want to cover for that subtopic on each subtopic card or cards. They will act as triggers for your main points. 9. Tell stories. Stories are the universal language; everyone relates to a story. Tell as story, make a point, tell a story, make a point, etc. Stories will make your speech much more interesting. 10. Practice your speech in front of a friend or a mirror. Practice looking at your audience more and your cards less. Time the length of the speech and tailor its length as needed. Remember - the greater crime is to bore the audience with a too long speech. Better to have a short and well-rehearsed one than a monologue that sends everyone into reverie. 11. Pretend that you are an expert talking to your friends when you give the speech.	You are sharing information with them.

Time for the tops. Since most cruises last around a week, you'll be needing enough clothes for that time. However, you will often find yourself changing clothes for special occasions or because of the weather, so be sure to pack extras. You should bring at least: * 6 t-shirts (even a crop top if you want) * 4-5 tank tops/camis (2 is fine) * 2 sweaters *	.

Because the zinc is a pretty thick substance, it will ensure your liquid foundation provides the coverage you desire, concealing any blemishes. It will make your skin appear smooth and soft. * You may need to experiment a bit to find out how much zinc oxide you like in your recipe. Typically, it requires anywhere from one to four teaspoons. * You can find zinc oxide at most pharmacies. 2. Mix clay in your foundation.	You can find different types of clay at some beauty supply stores, some pharmacies, and of course, online. These clays contain minerals that are healthy for your skin and absorb excess oil so they’re a great addition to your liquid foundation.

Thoroughly research exactly where in Florida you wish to live. Aside from basic necessities (area schools, jobs, hospitals, etc.), Florida is a huge state and is equally diverse. If you don't have your mind set on a specific city, then it helps to understand that there are five distinct regions of the state, one of which might be more attractive to you than the others. These regions are: * The Florida Panhandle: This is home to the state capital of Tallahassee and is known for its beautiful Gulf Coast beaches. Since Tallahassee is only from the Georgia border, it is known for its Southern charm and friendly people. * Northern Florida: This is home to the major cities of Gainesville and Jacksonville. It is known for its culturally Southern atmosphere and historic landmarks. * Central Florida: This is home to Disney World, SeaWorld and the Kennedy Space Center. Aside from the major tourist attractions, there are dozens of quaint small towns dotted with lakes in the region worth considering. * Southern Florida: This is the largest metropolitan area of the state and is home to the Everglades, Miami, West Palm Beach, and Key West. * Southwest Florida: This is home to Tampa, St. Petersburg, Naples, Sarasota and Ft. Myers. It is known for its museums, arts and theater, as well as its beautiful beaches. 2. Prepare for the weather. If you're moving from anywhere outside the Southeast, then say goodbye to snowstorms and cold spells; be ready to experience long days of hot, humid, muggy conditions throughout the summer. Cities along the coast are blessed with a slightly cooling ocean breeze, but inland communities (especially in Central Florida) often face stifling, stagnant heat. Summer storms, brief and often heavy, occur with such regularity you can almost set your watch to them. The rest of the year is typically dry and mild in most of the state, with the occasional cold spell during the winter. 3. Check potential homes for and mold or mildew. Homes that have been sitting vacant for months, possibly years without electricity (such as foreclosures), are especially vulnerable to these issues. Unless you've added the repair bills to your budget, try to avoid buying houses with these problems. 4. Start thinking about hurricane safety for your new house. Apartments and condominiums will usually take care of this for you, but you are on your own in a house. Begin by buying new or having existing hurricane shutters inspected, reinforce your roof and install hurricane glass. Get used to regularly stocking and re-stocking such supplies as non-perishable food, water (change every few months), battery radios, etc. Find out if your home is in a flood zone as soon as possible, preferably before settling the house. 5. Take precautionary measures for your skin. If your skin is very sensitive to the sun, you'll need to take extra care of it using lotions, creams, or other products as the Florida sun is very strong. The humidity also makes Florida very comfortable for mosquitoes, so if you're sensitive to bug bites, find and use a suitable spray or lotion that will keep them away. 6. Learn to speak Spanish. This is especially important if you plan to move to South Florida, with its population of Latino residents and influence of Latin American culture increasing. You'll feel more at home being able to use Spanish as well as English––there will be plenty of opportunities to learn Spanish when you're living there. 7. Be patient on the road. With a high volume of tourists and senior citizens on the road, it can be easy to get frustrated behind the wheel, confronted by slow drivers or motorists who appear to be lost. Stay calm, follow the signs and learn to be content with it. Florida is a big state with plenty to see, and because of its flat geographical makeup, it's a great place to explore by car. 8. Become a resident. Taking care of the legal incidentals of moving is a crucial step. See the State of Florida portal for more information on residency (http://www.stateofflorida.com/Portal/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=38). In particular, focus on your driver's license, insurance coverage, change of address, business needs if you run a business, etc. 9. Enjoy all that Florida has to offer. Great beaches, fascinating wildlife, big cities, tight-knit towns, excellent food and beautiful weather are just a few of the things to be experienced in Florida. * Spend a day at the beach. Florida has one of the longest contiguous coastlines of any state, with plenty to offer from sunbathing on the warm white sands to an array of water sports. *	About an hour from Orlando, the complex features a sprawling visitor center, rocket launch pad tours, and exotic wildlife viewing opportunities.

"""""""	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Use><1><use><4>	Deepening Your Knowledge  1. Connect terms and concepts to real-world situations. While you need to know lots of definitions, merely memorizing them won’t deepen your knowledge. Psychology is about the behavior and mental process of actual humans and other animals, so connect definitions to real-world examples. * For example, if you’re learning about aversion conditioning, imagine a smoker getting a light shock every time they reach for a cigarette. This type of therapy aims to build a negative association with a habit or behavior, so it’s often used combat addictions. 2. Participate in psychological research. Ask a local university’s psychology department if any professors or students are conducting psychological studies. Find out if they’re looking for test subjects or research assistants, and participate in any way you can. * You’ll need a firm grasp of experimental methods, and participating in psychological research will provide valuable first-hand experience. * Reaching out to college professors and students can be intimidating, but try not to be worried. Professors are usually eager to help young people interested in their research, and it wasn’t long ago that college students were in your shoes. 3. Master APA-style writing. American Psychological Association (APA) style is the standard manual for fields related to psychology. While you won’t need to cite texts on your AP exam, mastering the language and principles of APA style will improve the quality of your essays. * For example, APA-style writing is formal, so no abbreviations or contractions, and minimal humor, if any. It should also be straightforward, so no metaphors or unnecessary jargon. * It’s also important to use unbiased language free of negative connotations, especially when identifying people with disorders.	.

Begin by touching the crucifix and praying the Sign of the Cross. To make the Sign of the Cross, with your right hand touch your forehead, your heart, your left shoulder, and then your right. If you don't have a Rosary in your hands to hold, that's fine. You can keep track mentally. While making the Sign of the Cross, say: * English: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. * Latin: In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.  * Touch your forehead when you say Father, touch your breastbone when you say Son, touch your left shoulder when you say Holy, and touch your right shoulder when you say Spirit. 2. Pray the Apostle's Creed. If you have a Rosary, you are still holding the crucifix. With your head down and in a contemplative stance, say: * English: I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, died, and was buried; He descended into Hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; He shall come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. * Latin: Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae. Et in Iesum Christum, Filium eius unicum, Dominum nostrum, qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, passus sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus, descendit ad inferos, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit ad caelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis, inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos. Credo in Spiritum Sanctum, sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem, remissionem peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem, vitam aeternam. Amen. 3.	The traditional version reads thusly:

Learn about downs. When a team gets a 1st down, they need to get at least 10 yards forward from that spot to get another 1st down. This is what it means when people say things like 3rd and 4, or 2nd and long. The first number is the down and the second is the yards needed to get a first down (long means over 10 yards and goal means a first down would be a touchdown). The offense gets 4 downs to do this, but when they make it 10 yards, then it goes from whatever down it was to 1st down. On 4th downs, if the offense can't make a 1st down, they can punt the ball, which is where the punter kicks it as far downfield as possible, and the defense runs it back as far as possible. If the offensive players get to the ball before the receiving team does, they can down the ball by simply touching it, and that becomes the other team's first down. 2. You've got to know the positions: * Quarterback: The center snaps the ball to this player and then throws or hands off to a running back or wide receiver * Running Back: Gets the ball from the quarterback on run plays (go through certain spots in the line depending on the play) * Wide Receiver: The quarterback throws to them on pass plays (run routes) * Center: Snaps the ball to the quarterback then protects him from the defense * Guard: The players right next to the center who keep the defense out of the backfield * Tackle : The players right next to the guards that also help stop the defense from getting into the backfield * Linebacker: Defensive player that lines up behind the defensive linemen and, depending on what the play is, go between certain linemen * Defensive Lineman: Defensive player who lines up usually head up on an offensive lineman or outside shade of an O lineman * Cornerback: Defensive player who follows wide receivers on pass routes to keep them from catching passes * Free Safety: Defensive player that waits in the backfield and tries to make the tackle if the ball carrier gets past everybody else * Spur: Defensive player who usually rushes the quarterback and tries to make a sack * Kicker: Offensive player that kicks the ball at the start of the game, at the start of the 3rd quarter, and after touchdowns * Punter: Offensive player who kicks the ball if it is 4th down and the offense can't get a 1st down * Know the objective. Try to get as many points as you can before time runs out. The team with the most points wins. 3. Know the points system. A touchdown (when someone holding the ball steps into the end zone) is worth 6 points. Whenever a team scores a touchdown, they get a chance to kick a PAT, or point after touchdown. This is worth 1 point, or they can attempt a 2-point conversion, which is when a player holding the ball gets to the end zone. If an the ball carrier gets tackled in the end zone opposite the one they're trying to get to, it's called a safety, which is worth 2 points. The kickoff after a safety is kicked from the 20 yard line instead of the 50, where it is usually kicked from. 4. Learn the penalties and avoid them. A common penalty is offsides, which happens when the quarterback goes under the center to receive the snap, and before the ball is snapped,a player, either offensive or defensive, goes across the line of scrimmage (where the ball is on the field). This is a 5 yard penalty on the team who's player jumped offsides.	That is a 15 yard penalty.
Prevent_Benzodiazepine_Overdose.txt	### Taking the Medication as Prescribed	Benzodiazepines , including drugs like alprazolam , can affect seniors more than other adults .	### Taking the Medication as Prescribed	For instance , benzodiazepines , including drugs like alprazolam , can affect seniors more than other adults .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><instance><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Benzodiazepines><1><benzodiazepines><4>	Taking the Medication as Prescribed  1. Understand what benzodiazepines are prescribed for. This class of medications are used as tranquilizers that work on the central nervous system. They are used for things like anti-anxiety (such as diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, clorazepate, and chloridiazepoxide), muscle relaxation (such as diazepam), and sedation (such as estazolam, flurazepam, and temazepam). * They can also be used to treat things like convulsions (using diazepam or clonazapem, for instance) or alcohol withdrawal (using chlordiazepoxide). In some cases, they can be prescribed to help with anethesia, such as the drug midazolam. * However, because of their depressant effects, they are often used recreationally, which can lead to overdosing. 2. Take the drug orally. These drugs are generally taken orally, though some are given intravenously in the hospital. Either way is safe, as long as it is under the direction of a doctor. However, some people who abuse the drug crush it and ingest it through the nose. One of the main problems with this method is you can easily take more than you intend to, which could lead to overdosing. * Similarly, you shouldn't inject the drug yourself unless instructed by a doctor, as it can make it easier to overdose. 3. Stick to the recommended dose. The easiest way to avoid overdose is to follow the medication dosage provided by your doctor. Generally, you will start on a smaller dose, but your doctor may gradually move you up over time if you begin to develop a tolerance to the medication. Either way, sticking to the prescribed dosage should help you avoid an overdose. * If you're unclear about how often you should take your medication, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. * Don't try to change your dose on your own, even if you think the drug is not working. Always change dosages under the advice of a doctor. 4. Pay attention to the appropriate schedule. That is, you should only take benzodiazepines as often as your doctor or pharmacist says you can. Taking them more often will up the amount of the drug in your system, which could lead to overdosing. 5. Don't take other people's medications.	Specifically, the half-life is longer for seniors than for other adults, meaning it stays in your system longer. Therefore, it's easier to overdose, as you may take too much based on what's already in your system. Teens taking alprazolam may have similar problems. It's important to only take this medication if it is prescribed for you by a doctor.

Even if most of your ships have 30,000-70,000 HP, or even 90,000 HP, every single wrong action during the game can make your ship destroyed immediately. You need to act in advance before you collide with the land or other ships. If you turn the steering wheel of your car, it turns immediately to a direction. But the same situation won't happen in a ship. Even the lightest ship in WOWS is still thousands of tons, so you need to wait for a while for your ship to turn as it has a larger inertia. The larger the ship, the more time it needs to turn. Since it is different from driving on the road, lowering your speed will not decrease your turning radius. Hide yourself on the sea. If you are within enemy's range of fire and you are spotted by the enemy, you will surely get shot. So you should always remain unspotted unless enemy ships or aircraft enter your range of being spotted. Your concealment will also decrease if your ship is on fire or you shoot your guns. You need to learn the first skill to determine whether you are spotted.	.

For example, don't film a female individual's bare breasts, and put it up there, especially your bare breasts. The viewers can flag this as inappropriate. If it's flagged inappropriate too many times, the YouTube staff can delete the video and/or your profile. * Most importantly of all, DO NOT post other people's videos on YouTube without their permission.	Proxy servers keep a log of every user, and public computers are more easily traceable than you might think.

Know what a Bar/Bat Mitzvah is and isn't. * A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is a time to reflect on your spiritual self and find God. * A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is an acceptance of more responsibility. * A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is the time you become responsible for your own actions. * A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is an agreement to continue your Jewish education. * A Bar/Bat Mitzvah isn't the end or goal of your Jewish education. * A Bar/Bat Mitzvah isn't just about the party. * A Bar/Bat Mitzvah isn't a money-making opportunity. 2. Study Hebrew. Don't start learning Hebrew the year before your Bar/Bat Mitzvah, it should be a long process, usually starting when you are very young, in kindergarten or first grade. If its too late for that, you have some catching up to do. Learning Hebrew should be your goal, not just knowing enough for your Torah portion. You should be able to read your portion, not recite it from memory. 3. Learn about Judaism. If one is available, go to religious school and attend it as if it were a regular school. In order to fully appreciate your Bar/Bat Mitzvah, you need to understand the culture you are a part of. Next time you go to a Passover Seder, really listen to what is being said and ask questions. Join in the discussion, and add your insights to what the Haggadah is talking about.	.
Play_Big_Booty.txt	## Tips	A Korean alternative is to give each person a name and action instead of numbers .	### Learning Variations	For example , a Korean alternative is to give each person a name and action instead of numbers .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><A><1><a><4>	Tips  * To build momentum and/or encourage dancing, you can also gradually increase the tempo as you go. * Another way to play the game is to double the underlying tempo, which is more challenging to learn but makes it easier to figure out who has no rhythm. Instead of one beat per phrase, it would be two beats. Ex.: * Pat "big", pat "booty" * Clap "big", clap "booty" * Pat "Big", pat "booty" * Two claps with no words * Pat "oh", pat "yeah" * Two claps with no words * Pat "big", pat "booty"… and so forth * If you get stuck in a jam, a person can yell out, "Big Booty, break it down." This then turns into an eight-count breakout dance for everyone, after which Big Booty starts the song again. Everyone stays put and gets a chance to do a silly little dance and go on with the game. * The leader should wait only a few seconds before starting a new round; this gives people less time to become familiar with their numbers, and keeps the momentum of the game going. * To make it more difficult, a person can say "Big Booty" in place of their own number. For instance, "Number Three" passing the turn to "Big Booty" would say "Big booty, big booty" instead of "Number three, big booty." This makes the game more challenging because it the person whose turn it is has a harder time remembering everyone's number. *	After choosing a theme (for example, superheroes), everyone picks a name and related action (ex.: Spiderman; holding out wrists to shoot “spider web”). Ideally, each name and action can be played out over 2 beats. For simplicity, saying one's own name is omitted: on beats 1 and 2, everyone does "Pat, Clap" without chant. On beats 3 and 4, the person singing gives the name and performs the action of the next person while everyone else does a left snap and a right snap to keep the tempo. (This means indiscernible action and wrong name/action combination are added to the mistakes list.) Instead of being kicked out, players who make a mistake are usually playfully punished (for example, drumming on the back), and the game is resumed.

Determine which radial you are on by turning the OBS (Omni Bearing Selector) knob until the CDI (Course Deviation Indicator) needle is centered and you have a FROM indication. Looking at the picture to the right, you can see the needle is centered and it gives a FROM indication (small white triangle pointing to "FR"), so the aircraft is on the 254 radial. It doesn't matter what the heading of the aircraft is, it is located somewhere along a line 254&deg; from the VOR station.	Note that this will be 74 degrees, the reciprocal heading (opposite direction) of 254. Now turn the aircraft to this new heading and keep the needle centered- this will take you to the VOR station.

Review investments in capital. Capital investments are all of the funds the company used to buy equipment that can produce goods or services. When a company purchases capital equipment, the total expense is not reflected on the income statement. Rather, the total value of the asset is recorded on the balance sheet, and depreciation expense is recorded over time on the income statements. But, if a company purchases capital equipment with cash during the time period for which it is preparing the statement of cash flows, this outflow of cash must be included. 2. Determine the impact of financing activities. Financing activities include issuing and redemption of long and short term debt, issuing and retirement of stock and payment of stock dividends. These activities can have positive and negative effects on cash flow. Issuing debt and stock increase the company’s cash. Redeeming debt and paying stock dividends decreases cash. 3. Make adjustments for investments and financing. Add in cash paid for purchasing capital equipment. Subtract cash paid to redeem debt or pay dividends. Add in cash raised by issuing stock or new debt. * They purchased new computer equipment and assembly line machinery for a total of $4,000,000.

Network in the art community to get to know artists, and select new artists who will be anxious to give their work exposure. They might take a chance on the your new gallery if you are willing to take a chance on them. * Focus on creating good working relationships with your artists. This will help you in understanding and promoting their work. It may also ensure that you remain their gallery of choice even when their work gains more recognition. 3. Focus on making sales. Look at your collections through a business lens, not simply an artistic one. It is important to display art that you like, but more important to display art that will sell. Remember, you have to keep the lights before you can sell the art that you want to sell. Use your knowledge of art the market to choose investment pieces and art that will sell well given your market and clientele. *	That is, don't showcase art that costs $100,000 in one show and then $1,000 pieces in the next.

Ultimately you cannot convince him you have been faithful and you end up in tears .	<insert><Ultimately><1>|||<replace><You><1><you><2>	Steps  1. Note how he behaves when you're out in public. When you are out, he watches you intently when you are conversing with others. Your initial thought is that he is admiring you. You carry on chatting. He doesn’t smile. The ‘admiration’ becomes an intense glare – maybe even gesticulating with his hand and pointing with two fingers to his eyes (I am watching you). He imagines that you will go off with one of the people you have been talking to. He has your attention again, and you wonder what you may have done wrong, smile and shrug it off jokingly – after all, part of life is conversation, laughter and generally feeling happy. Why should he have a problem? 2. Be wary if she makes some snide, undermining comment that leaves you questioning your own personality and perhaps wondering if you really are the tart /flirt / trollop / tease that she describes. 3. You are going for a night out with friends / family / work colleagues. He’s not invited. Not because he’s not wanted, just because that’s how things are. In the days leading up to the evening, he becomes grumpy, snappy. Everything you do is wrong. He belittles your every comment. Puts you down for no reason. Criticises you. 4. If you ask for his opinion about your attire prior to the evening. He may offer the following: * Are you sure you are comfy in that? * Perhaps it’s too short or revealing? * Have you got your sexy underwear on, just in case you pull? 5. He offers you the key to his home – to build up trust. You can come and go as you please – he has nothing to hide. There maybe a toothbrush at his, that he has personally bought for you – or a dressing-gown. Refusal is not an option. 6. You sense that he may be a little insecure about you going out and try to build his confidence and reassure him. You think he is wonderful and want the relationship to work. 7. He’ll check your phone. 8. Mind games are frequent. Conversation is turned on its head to the point you can’t remember exactly what you said, but you are in the wrong. You find yourself feeling guilty again and having to answer for, and justify your actions. 9. You are late home from work. 10. Therefore you have been sha**ing the boss in your sexy underwear (earlier question). Over the desk was it? No? Then you have been to the pub, or ‘you have started an affair – and it’s only a short time before you will end the relationship’. 11. Your confidence is nose-diving. 12. You end up spending more time with him than your family, because you want your relationship to be happy and don’t like upsetting him. 13. You doubt yourself as a person and maybe there is a possibility you will be ‘swooned off your feet’...you avoid such situations, so don’t venture out – it’s easier than the grief / conflict that ensues. 14. You really enjoy his company. When it’s just you and him and no outside influences, life is wonderful. You fall in love and want to be with him forever. 15. He is charming. 16. A proper Gent. 17. Pulls out the chair for you to sit down. 18. Opens the car door for you to get in. 19. Links your arm as you walk. 20. Holds your coat for you to put it on. 21. Anything at all you want to do is fine by him. 22. He has so many good points. 23. He likes cooking. 24. He adores spoiling you and buys you a beautiful piece of jewellery within months of you meeting – he knows a lovely jewellers... 25. Or an expensive dress, if you go out with him a little longer. 26. He has no objection to helping around the home. Doing DIY. Cutting the grass. 27. YOU ARE LOSING YOUR INDEPENDENCE. 28. Which, sadly, is the very thing that attracted him in the first place. 29. You spend entire weeks together. 30. He talks about moving in together. Things are going so well, you consider it. 31. Life is fantastic! 32. You have a man that adores you (and your child(ren)), but you haven’t been out for a drink with your mates for months. 33. He offers to lend you his car. It’s newer and smarter than yours...but if you are a minute late getting it back you are in such trouble. 34. Parents? 35. Piece of p*ss compared to this man. 36. Seven months into the relationship, you think the trust would be there. After all, you have given him no cause for concern. You love him – surely he knows that? 37. He offers to pick you up after an evening out with friends/colleagues. 38. You have had a good evening. 39. You are more than happy to discuss the events of the evening and the laugh you have had. 40. You are looking forward to snuggling up in bed together... 41. Laughter and good mood rapidly dissolve as he finds any reason to pick at you. 42. You have to work all weekend. It’s a one-off. 43. Now you are definitely having an affair. 44. You are also a liar – especially as your mobile phone ‘conveniently’ went flat / you didn’t answer his text within 10 mins. 45. He’s helped you out of a seemingly miserable existence and you should be grateful. 46. He wants the money back for the holiday you have booked – just in case you do a runner with his share. 47. Your heart is broken. 48. You are crying against the wall. 49. How can he not know you love and adore him, yet he chooses to blame you for his temper / anger? 50. He promises he will change. He doesn’t know why he is like this. Perhaps he loves you too much. It’s never happened before. He’s just frightened of being without you. 51. Xmas do – partners are not invited. Again, not because of anything, just the way it is. 52. Why? 53. What’s going off? “You came to mine. Why can’t I come to yours?” 54. How old is this man? 55. He deliberately tries to make you jealous. Chats intently, flirtily, sexily, happily to your friends. Wins over their respect and confidence – He is a good man. 56. Try to chat to his mates in the same manner? FORGET IT! 57. You have spent the weekend with your best mate of X years. 58. He refuses to let you see him once they have gone (good job he is Pinocchio, as he has just spited another piece of his nose) – just to get at you for your little misdemeanour. 59. Yes, you know you should get out of this unhealthy relationship, but there is a magnetic field surrounding this guy that keeps pulling you in. 60. It’s an elastic band that keeps stretching every time he hurts you. But it’s a big bugger and there’s a long way to go yet. 61. He believes you are avoiding him if you don’t respond almost immediately to his texts. The fact that you forgot your phone, it’s on charge in the other room, you didn’t hear it beep / ring is irrelevant. Once it’s repossessed / charged – it comes complete with a barrage of abuse. 62. He accuses you of affairs for no reason. 63. If you so much as mention a male college, he goes up the wall. 64. You are a stupid trollop / b**ch / cow / girl / kid. 65. You may wake up one morning to find him standing over you at the side of the bed. 66. It’s not love in his eyes. 67. Asks you how much for sex? A joke of course, but it doesn’t wear thin. 68. Red light would suit your room. 69. You are not comfortable with some of the sexual activities you are embarking on, but it’s ok. He loves you. 70. So when you endeavour to try something new as you have a confidence in the bedroom you never knew... 71. “Who taught you that? Your boss / friend?” 72. You are a dirty whore. 73. This man is supposed to love and adore you???? 74. Immediately you feel dirty, humiliated. 75. You change jobs / start a course, and immediately he thinks he is not good enough for you and you’ll end the relationship. 76. You reassure him nothing will change as it’s him you love and unless there is something wrong in your relationship, no-one else will be able to come between you. 77. He’s not reassured. 78. The topic raises its head on numerous occasions. 79. You tell him you love him – he goes quiet. Sends daggers your way. 80. He still wants to sh*g though – after all, he is a bloke and has needs. 81. It’s rough sex, like he’s trying to punish you. He loves you though. 82. He’s angry. But why? You haven’t done anything wrong except try to better yourself. Perhaps it’s for something you may do in the future...? 83. He likes to take photos during sex / of your private parts. He promises they are for his eyes only, and he will delete them. 84. They will come back to haunt you when he is texting nasty messages telling you to watch out for c**ts. 85. His jealousy is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 86. He keeps telling you that you will leave him, but he is doing nothing to keep you except push you away. 87. He’s been pushing the self-destruct button. 88. He believes he is keeping the relationship together. 89. Oh, by-the-way. He can’t live without you and may at sometime pretend to commit suicide, or play dead. But sadly, he knows you care about him and instead of calling his bluff and letting him, you call the police as you are worried. 90. A night in a mental institute serves nothing as he is a clever, sweet-talking bar-steward. 91. YOU ARE LEFT FEELING GUILTY & BURDENED. 92. Your family & friends are affected. 93. His family and friends are affected. 94. He is nothing but a selfish TW*T!! 95. He agrees to go for counselling for his jealousy. He manages the first installment and says its not for him. 96. Maybe he is depressed? The doctor has given him tablets. 97. He doesn’t beat you, but verbally abuses you. Not in public, but afterwards. 98. You dread going out in case there’s any conflict / accusations. You daren’t look in the direction of another male – even accidentally. 99. You can’t swing your legs on a barstool, as this is provocative. 100. At least if he beat you, you may come to your senses and realise that he is worth nothing. But... 101. The evening usually ends in tears – yours. 102. You have again done nothing wrong...but you have, haven’t you?!?!?!?!? 103. Refuses to go to parties / family events with you. 104. Doesn’t like unfamiliar places. 105. Punishes you by making you wait on him. 106. Never looks happy when you turn up unannounced and surprise him. 107. As I said, this isn’t in any particular order. 108. You invite him for tea. He turns up absolutely pissed and says he’s not hungry. You forgo tea, and carry on with the rest of the evening. It’s pleasant, for about half-an-hour. Then he proceeds to chat to every old friend / ex / neighbour he can find. You are again being punished, but even I am not sure why! 109. The same favour is not returned when you go out and get pissed – probably because the friend in question is male. 110. He’s hard work. Conversation is always stilted if you aren’t feeling congenial. 111. He always said you were good company. 112. You keep trying, because he is a good guy and has a wonderful heart and loves you deeply like no other ever could and spoils you rotten and wants to marry you and loves your kid(s) and only occasionally makes you feel like a tramp and does believe in foreplay – only because he has trouble getting it up, but we haven’t got that far yet (OK, we have, and it stems from a previous relationship and something to do with not being able to get it up in his own place due to... In reality, it has to do with the in fact that he has no respect for women). 113. He is a good guy and has a heart of gold. You have told your child(ren) that. They must always be civil to him and show him respect. 114. He doesn’t beat you, but verbally abuses you and strips your confidence. You cannot talk to anyone, because all your friends are now his – AND HE IS A GOOD GUY. 115. You are terribly lonely. 116. Your family cannot understand why you don’t just get out of this destructive relationship. 117. You believe he will change – after all, he loves you. 118. He’s just a little insecure. 119. You try to end it, but; 120. ‘You are my life. I want to marry you. Grow old with you...’ 121. Confuses you. 122. Offers to help you with those jobs he knows you cannot really do alone. 123. You miss him terribly. Still love him and always will because you have never, ever felt like this. 124. Your heart is broken. 125. You agree to be friends. 126. But his idea of friends is not yours. 127. He constantly wants to touch you. 128. You just want some space for a short time. 129. He’s says he is moving out of the area, it’s for the best (5 months later, there is no movement, only his still undying love for you ...and his new friend (titled for you)). 130. You leave evenings early, because you know that if he hasn’t had your undivided attention as you have sat next to, and talked to your son / Dad / brother / friend / family friends, that there will be grief to come. 131. He tries to pick a fight with a family friend whom you have known for 20yrs, because he ‘looked at you in a certain way’. 132. A text. 133. A phone call. 134. Must be from your lover. 135. He criticises friends and family. 136. It’s not him, it’s the booze. 137. We’ll give up and find other things to do... 138. He has his own children and grandchildren, but as much as you encourage him to spend time with them, he chooses to spend it with you. Saying that they don’t care about him. 139. They don’t appear to visit either. 140. They only seem to phone when there’s a crisis or they need money. 141. Is he a surrogate Father because he failed miserably in his real role as a Dad? 142. He says he’s not stupid, he knows you are having affair. 143. You offer to let him listen to voice messages, so he knows you are telling the truth. 144. More reassurance and massaging his ego. 145.	.

Protest by all means, it’s normal and natural. But avoid being really nasty, it’s hard to come back from that. 2. Don’t let your angry rebellion cause you to forget who got you this far. And remember, you will be out on your own soon enough - with all the responsibility you can handle. 3. Protesting is a way of having what you want instead of what your parents say you need. It can be done constructively. And a smart person would do it that way because you are more likely to get what you want - what you are protesting for or about. 4. Stick to the house rules, they are there for everyone’s benefit not just yours. Try to do what is asked of you, the more you moan and complain the more difficult YOU make the task. Just get it over and done with - done and dusted - just like that. 5. Consider the ‘give and take’ policy. You want something then be prepared to negotiate instead of yelling across the room. Be willing to compromise - a favour for a favour.	.

Does your child scream and hit you and even your spouse? Talk to your spouse about it..Does your child show a distinct lack of empthay toward you, other children or family pets? Seek help from a Health Professional. 2. Don't fight back with hitting, punching or kicking. Retaliation is child abuse, although if you are being physically attacked by your teenager you have a right to defend yourself, or other members of your family. Do not let embarrasment stop from from calling the police. Like all bullies, the abuser is banking on you not saying anything. The more they get away with the abuse-the longer it will continue. 3. Call your child's pediatrician. Seek professional help. You will be surprised at how many other parents are going through this too. You are not alone. 4. Don't ignore it. Tyrants are made, and when we ignore then or let them continue being abusive, rude, bullying and arrogant-we help to make them. 5.	However, if you need a break, don't be afraid to aske for help from from family or friends. Often a child will behave better for someone else, and save the really bad behaviour for home.
Soothe_a_Dog's_Itchy_Ears.txt	### Relieving the Itch Immediately	You can give your dog 2 mg of a common antihistamine , like diphenhydramine , for every kilogram of body weight .	### Relieving the Itch Immediately	Then you can give your dog 2 mg of a common antihistamine , like diphenhydramine , for every kilogram of body weight .	<insert><Then><1>|||<replace><You><1><you><2>	Relieving the Itch Immediately  1. Know when to see a veterinarian. If you've noticed your dog constantly scratching his ears, get him examined. The vet will use a tool (otoscope) to examine deep inside the ear canal and check if the eardrum (tympanum) is intact. The vet will also look for other causes of itchy ears. For example, the vet may swab your dog's ears to diagnose an infection. * If your dog is in so much pain that an examination is difficult, the vet may choose to sedate him and clean out the ear. This allows the vet to see the eardrum and helps topical treatments be absorbed by the skin. * Don't attempt giving topical ear treatments to your dog without seeing the vet first. If the eardrum is damaged, medication could cross into the middle or inner ear, causing permanent balance and hearing problems (possibly even deafness). 2. Be cautious about using tea tree oil. While some may recommend using this essential oil to calm inflamed or infected skin, know that it contains terpenes, which are toxic to dogs. Animals can tolerate tea tree oil that has been diluted to 0.1 to 1.0%, but most shampoos, disinfectants, and skin treatments sold by pet shops contain stronger amounts which could harm your dog. If you do use a tea tree oil product, make sure it's very diluted. * Watch for signs of terpene toxicity if you choose to use tea tree oil. Toxic signs include nausea, vomiting, and, commonly in both cats and dogs, paralysis. Serious cases of paralysis, seizures, and even death have also been associated with tea tree oil. 3. Try giving your dog antihistamines. If you're unsure what's causing your dog's itchy ears, you'll want to get him some relief until you can determine the problem.	Usually these are tablets given orally, three times a day. Antihistamines work by blocking and preventing inflammation.

Be where the operator can see you, whether he is on a tractor, on a swather or in a combine. 2. Always let someone know where you are, where you are going to be and when you will be back at all times. 3. Never overestimate your strength and speed when handling both machinery and livestock. 4. Always have an escape route. This is especially important when handling potentially dangerous animals. 5. Never climb nor reach over a running/spinning PTO shaft. Always walk around the machine to get to the other side. If you have to work in the area where the PTO shaft is, turn off everything first or ensure that the tractor is out of gear (where the unit where the PTO hooks up is not spinning), before working in that particular area. 6. Always make sure the tractor and/or machine is turned off before you climb in to fix something or have a look at something. 7. Check that the machine you are about to turn on is in the Neutral or Park position. Also, be aware of what's around you before you turn the machine on or start moving. If any children are in the area, make sure they are at a safe distance (which is at least 50 to over 100 feet away) and that they stay where they are. No exceptions! 8. If a child is wanting to go somewhere away from where you are working,make sure you have told the child before hand that it is very important that they tell you where they are going before they go anywhere. 9. When working from any machinery, always keep an eye for things that are beside and behind you,don't just focus on what's in front of you. 10. Do not wear loose clothing nor wear your hair loose when working around moving mechanical parts. You will easily get caught up and even sucked up into the machine before you even knew what happened. Survivability of such accidents is extremely rare. Most people who survive from such an event often die of traumatic shock shortly after. 11. Wear eye/ear/foot protection when and where possible.	.

The first thing you should do is combine like terms so that all of the constant terms are on the right side of the equation while the term with the exponent is on the left side. Just subtract 12 from both sides. Here's how: * 2x+12-12 = 44-12 * 2x = 32 3.	In this case, 2 is the x coefficient, so divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of it. Here's how:

Planning * Great sensual and erotic role play requires some forethought. * Plan your erotic role play over several days or weeks. Having a few minutes of dirty talk just before you start having sex isn’t the same as setting out a sensual role play scene. Erotic role play can take you deeper into another character and release you from the restrictions you put on yourself in your daily life. It means more preparation, and more risks, but the difference is palpable, and worth it! * Someone has to start or initiate the 'game'. Talk about it to each other and then help each other along. Start by talking about the idea and then begin sending your lover, husband or wife messages, clues and suggestions over a week or 2 and build up towards a sexy night out. * Most people start out a bit shy and nervous with the idea of dressing up as someone else and playing a role. Much of this reticence comes from a lack of preparation. The best way to get comfortable with sexual role playing is to be prepared. * If you're planning the 'game' together, start the preparation a week before. Send each other naughty text messages. Look on-line for naughty or sexy hint pictures and e-mail each other. Start your very own on-line relationship. It's a fun way to share your desire for one another. When you're at home, you're probably too busy looking after the kids and doing household chores to take time to seduce each other so texting, e-mail and social network sites can be a fun way to spend time seducing each other. * Build up the anticipation. Don't talk about it to each other while doing the dishes, use e-mail and text messages. It's a fun and loving distraction to your day at work. Imagine receiving a sexy text message while you're sitting in a boring meeting or coming back from your lunch break to find a naughty e-mail from your lover. * If you're planning the event together and plan to go out of town or stay out for the night, arrange for the kids to spend the afternoon and night at granny or a friend, get someone to look after the pets etc. Your erotic role-play evening is going to be hot and you're going to want to stay out all night. Your ordinary life will still be there when you get back the next day but the memory of your steamy night out will last forever. * Pick a sensual role that feels right. * Character and Scenario ideas: * Jane hires male escort James * John hires call-girl Jenna * Gina heads down-town to meet a man * Tom finds Taryn on Facebook * Dita the Dominatrix puts out an ad for a slave * Nikki sends a naughty text message to John the stranger * Angel the private dancer receives a text message * Donna dresses to tease, Daniel pays attention * Sara meets Stefan on a blind date * Tina sings a sexy/romantic duet with Steve the Stranger at the Karaoke Bar * Chris the photographer meets Gina the model * Christine the photographer meets Paul the model * Consider the psychology of your role. Analyze your character. What’s your motivation? What turns your character on, what turns your partner on, what pushes your partner's buttons or drives him or her wild? Are you dominant? Submissive? * Details can take you deeper into a sensual role play scenario. When you first imagine a sexual scene the main points may be enough to get you started, but the more detail you can add to the game the more alive it becomes. Details can also be great for awkward moments when you don’t know what to do next. * Erotic role play is a perfect opportunity to dress up and have fun. Once you’ve decided on your role or character, think about ways to add to your character and role through clothing and props. * Starting is the hardest part but once the game gets going, you'll find that it develops a life of it's own. * One partner begins by sending her a message as a secret admirer, male escort, call-girl, sexy co-worker or sexy stranger. The other partner responds and the game begins. * He could also create and advert for himself as a male escort offering his special services. He sends her an e-mail, she responds. If the response is positive (hopefully with some tongue in cheek) then the lines of erotic conversation are officially open. * If you're the lady who wants to seduce her partner or husband with the John/Call-girl game then create a sexy ad for yourself. Create an ad using a sexy pic of yourself or find one on-line. A picture of a pair of legs in sexy stockings with a catch phrase and a phone number. "Divine Honeymore wants to wrap her sexy legs around you. Text 555-35-22-56" The ad needn't be sleazy and needn't involve nudity or pictures of yourself. There are thousands of images on-line that can be copied into your very own high-class call-girl ad. Go as far as you're comfortable with. * Use a new e-mail address or create a new facebook profile using your new call-girl, male escort, stripper or sexy stranger name. * The rules of engagement could be communicated via e-mail, social networking or text messaging during the 'on-line' dating phase. What are the boundaries? Set ground rules for your erotic role game. Some of these rules should be common sense and common courtesy, like no laughing or judging each other in the moment. Other rules will take some thought and good communication. * If you're the guy planning the invitation, send her a secret admirer text or e-mail. Create a new e-mail account with your new name or use a different cellular phone number. Send her romantic messages and begin your seduction a week before the grand 'event'. * If you're playing the John meets sexy stranger game, and you've both agreed to meet at a particular restaurant, then the scenario could be started weeks in advance as a 'secret on-line' affair where you finally meet for the first time. * If either of you are planning this game as a surprise, book the entire day off work or play out the role on your day off. Check that your partner will at least have the evening off. * The role-play game of John meets Call-Girl or sexy stranger needn't be sleazy. Think more along the lines of high class call-girl or escort instead of street-corner prostitute. * Jane hires Male Escort is a similar game but with the roles reversed and with "Jane" in control. She's in town for a night and hires a male escort for the evening. He must do anything and everything she wants but he has a few surprises and tricks of his own… * Try to book an evening in a hotel that has a restaurant and bar or at least close by. If you don't have the budget for a fancy hotel, a decent roadside motel can work just as well. If you're shy or trying this fantasy role for the first time, then stick with a neat and simple hotel where you'll both feel comfortable. * If you're on a budget then at least prepare your bedroom for the steamy end to the evening. * If either of you are not comfortable playing out a call-girl or male escort scenario, then substitute the roles for John meets sexy stranger. At the end of the evening, John goes home with pretty woman and the couple end up making wild passionate love to each other. * Invite your partner to a 'blind date' - do something you wouldn't ordinarily do. Go to a Karaoke Bar, pick a song you both love and sing it together. Hang out at the bar like you've just met. Make out like it's your first time, take a cab home or to a hotel and finish what you started. * Invite your partner to meet you at a particular stall at a theme park, chat as strangers and go on all the scary rides together, share a milkshake, bump each other at the bumper cars, make out on the Ferris wheel, take a taxi to the nearest hotel (or to 'his/her' place) and complete the evening. * For the partner that's planning to do most of the seduction, plan your seduction routine. Dating is a chase, plan it as such. * The game is less about the outcome of the evening - that's almost predicable and you've experienced the final outcome hundreds of times. Explore the art seduction (seduce or allow yourself to be seduced), with verbal foreplay (sensual innuendos) , teasing (touch, visual temptation). * Couples could agree to keep the arrangements formal and business-like. He may make certain requests and she may do the same. He could specify that he wants a tall red-head, she could specify she doesn't do make out with men that have facial hair. If she's short and blonde, she'll have to dye her hair or wear a wig and tall heels. If he has a beard, he'll have to shave it all off. She's entitled to ask for a deposit to book her exclusive 'services'. She could use the deposit to go to the hair salon or purchase a wig and new shoes for her 'customer'. * Use words to seduce your partner. Say your partner's name. Take time to explore the erotic art of talking. Throw in a bit of romance, think Pretty Woman. Make an evening of it. * Conversation and communication is just as important if not more important than the venue, outfit and activities. * Plan your evening's activities. Anything can happen so take a few of your favorite sex toys and accessories. If you've planned the experience together with your partner, agree on tasks (example: who books hotel where) but keep the specific details secret from one another. Surprises are sexy. * He books the hotel, she books the restaurant or chooses the bar. *	.

Yet, your return has been negative! The fund company even compares their fund to the Nasdaq, as shown in the image. How is it possible that your return is negative? 2. Understand that your investments are as shown by the image. You start with a $1000 investment on April 1, 1998, then continue with other $1000 investments every 6 months so that, by April 1, 2001 your portfolio is worth $6924. Now, calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) or "annualized return". * Use the Excel command XIRR as described here: Calculate Annualized Portfolio Return. It's -0.73%. What happened? Why the negative annualized return? 3. Understand that fund companies quote the result of a single investment without additions or withdrawals over 3 years. * Look again at the chart comparing the mutual fund to the Nasdaq. For the Nasdaq chart, it's $10K invested on April 1, 1998 and no further monies go in or out. However, your mutual fund investments are periodic. If you invest $1000 at a time when the asset has a high price, then the asset drops in value, you'll get a negative return for that $1000 investment. 4. Realize what has happened. Investing periodically is called Dollar Cost Averaging (or DCA). See: Analyze Dollar Cost Averaging (Dca). An asset whose price fluctuates can give negative returns for some and positive returns for other of your periodic investments. *	Rarely. Sometimes your periodic investments do better, sometimes worse.

Place the scissors against the stem where you plan to make your cut. The scissors should be just above the leaves on a bare part of the stem. * You may try to cut several stems at once, depending on the size of your plant.

Recycle_Old_Pantyhose.txt	## Steps	Use them to stuff any craft item , from teddies to pillows to tiny Christmas tree ornaments .	## Steps	As well , use them to stuff any craft item , from teddies to pillows to tiny Christmas tree ornaments .	<insert><As><1>|||<insert><well><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Use><1><use><4>	Steps  1. Use your old pantyhose instead of a mesh bag to wash your delicate articles . Cut your pantyhose at about the thigh, or just use the entire thigh high stocking. Place your delicate washables in the stocking, tie off the open end and launder as usual. 2. Use them to scrub your bathroom, shower or sink. Spritz some cleaner on your sink, shower, or tub surface. Then, get a piece of your pantyhose and dampen it with either water or more cleaning solution. Next, scrub away the dirt and grime using the pantyhose cutoff much like you would use a regular washcloth. Want to make it even easier? Cut off the pantyhose at the calf and slip the piece over your hand for a cleaning mitt that works magic! 3. Use your old stockings to make a bath infusion sachet. Using herbs in the bath is a calming experience that fills the air with beautiful scents, transforming your bath from a cleaning routine to a transforming experience. To make one of these bath "tea bags," simply cut off your stockings at the calf, fill it with your favorite herbs, tie off the open end, and float the sachet in your bathwater. 4. Use your old pantyhose for soap shavings. If you like a more bubbly bath, consider adding all of your old soap slivers into a stocking. Cut off the pantyhose leg at about the calf, and start collecting those soap pieces. When you have a decent amount of soap in the stocking, tie off the open end and swish it around the water to whip up some suds. You can use the soap filled stocking as a gentle scrubber for your skin. 5. Hang dry sweaters without those pesky hanger marks. Take a pair of pantyhose and put one leg through each sleeve or, if you are using thigh high stockings or half a pair of pantyhose, slip one leg through both arms of the sweater. Next, tie the two ends of the stocking to your clothesline and let the sweater dry. 6. Strain your paint. Take an old pair of pantyhose and cut them so that you have a usable piece of nylon that will stretch over a container. Then, pour your lumpy paint slowly over the mesh surface, letting the debris-free paint flow into the new container. 7. Store onions and garlic. Air circulation is a great way to keep onions and garlic around longer. Take a pair of clean pantyhose and cut them off at the thigh, or simply use an entire thigh high stocking. Then, place the onions or garlic into the stockings like a sleeve, tie off the end, and store them hanging up in your pantry. 8. Make garden ties out of them! The legs of pantyhose actually make very good plant ties, as they are soft and pliable. They might not look great at the front of the border, but hide them at the back and they'll do the job perfectly! 9. Sieving. If you ever need to sieve anything very finely, such as pigments, ceramic glazes, liquids, or even when cooking, then a length of pantyhose is great. Cut the leg lengthwise so that you have a square piece of fabric, and tie or tape it over the top of your bowl. Sieve through it. 10. Stuff toys or animals with the pantyhose. Cut up old pantyhose make a good stuffing material for stuffed toys. If you are a crafter, then save all your old pantyhose and chop them into short lengths.	.

Disinfect the wound. Fish hooks are really dirty. They have been in pond or lake water, filled with bacteria, algae, pond scum and whatever else is living in there. Use a saline solution liberally on the wound to disinfect it immediately after getting the hook out. * If you don’t have saline solution on hand, beverages with a high alcoholic content, like vodka or rum, will work in a pinch. This is not an ideal solution, but most fishermen are more likely to have alcohol on their boats than saline solution. * Hydrogen peroxide has long been used to disinfect fresh wounds. However, recent studies have proven this product to be largely ineffective. Some studies even suggest that it can cause more damage to the injured area. 2. Wash the wound quickly. You will want to rinse out the wound with cool water and antibacterial soap as soon as possible. If you don’t have these things on the boat with you, a bottle of drinking water is a temporary solution until you can reach medical supplies. * Wash the wound out as soon as possible after the hook is removed. This will go a long way in avoiding infection. * Apply antibiotic cream and a bandage. Once you have disinfected and cleaned the wound, apply an antibiotic cream or ointment and attach a clean bandage to the wound. This will help kill any remaining bacteria and help to keep the wound free of dirt. * Change the bandage often and allow the wound to breathe from time to time. * You may need to get stitches is the wound is particularly deep. 3.	Fishing hooks are often rusty. Even if the hook doesn’t appear to be rusty, it can still carry tetanus bacteria. So get a tetanus shot. While no one likes getting shots, it is far better to err on the side of caution because the alternative is very unpleasant.

Get the right fit for your shoes. Make sure your running shoes fit your feet as close as they can without being too tight. You don't want to be distracted by blisters in the middle of your run. The longer you run, the better your shoes need to be. * If you run every day, your shoes will only last 4-6 months. If your feet all of a sudden begin hurting, it's high time to get a new pair. * There are shoe stores like Running Revolution and Road Runner Sports that can design shoes for your feet. If you have an extra dollar to spare, consider getting shoes that match your arch and shape. 2. Warm up. Walk briskly for 5 minutes before you start running. This will get your circulation going without expending too much energy prematurely. It's all about getting primed. * Do some core exercises, too. Regardless of whether you're sprinting or running long distances, the importance of warming up remains the same. 3. Jog when you're tired. When you're tired, try lowering your pace to a slow jog and ramping back up to running as soon as you can. Ramping down to a walk will break your cadence and drastically limit how much ground you cover. * For beginning runners, a common goal is running for around 30 minutes -- that's a 5K. If time is a factor you're considering, try timing your miles or kilometers and aiming for a specific, timed goal. 4. Sip water.	Guzzling water in the middle of a run will lead to cramps.

Keep the cap or lid on the oil bottle when you are not using it. One of the things that causes oil to go rancid is oxygen. When oil gets too much oxygen, it turns rancid. If you are not using your oil, keep the cap or lid on the container. 2. Store oil in a dark-colored glass bottle with a tight-fitting cap. Even if your oil comes in a clear, glass bottle, you might want to transfer it to a blue or green one. Sunlight degrades the quality of oil, and a dark-colored bottle will help keep that from happening. Use a funnel to help guide the oil to the new bottle. * Brown colored glass is not recommended because it lets too much light in. * If you own more than one type of oil, don't forget to label the bottles. * You can reuse dark-colored wine and vinegar bottles. * You can also buy dark-colored bottles from a cooking equipment store. 3. Avoid plastic bottles. Plastic tends to leech chemicals overtime.	If your oil came in a plastic bottle, consider transferring it to a glass bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid.

Organize your notes well. Write everything in the correct place in your outline so you don’t have to organize your notes again later. Highlight urgent items by underlining or circling them. You can also use mind mapping techniques, or even draw pictures in your notes. * Mind mapping, either on paper or using a mind mapping software program, is great for brainstorming sessions where ideas are being thrown out and sorted. * Drawing your notes may actually help you remember better than writing them out. You don’t have to draw every single thing, since that would take too much time. But you can draw out certain things in your notes if it will help you remember them better. * You can also use signs and arrows to compliment your written notes. For example, instead of writing “John needs to update the excel sheet” you can write “excel sheet” and then draw an arrow to John’s name where you wrote the names of the meeting attendees. 2. Focus on what’s important. It is usually not possible or productive to write down everything that is said in the meeting word-for-word. Be sure to write down decisions and action-items. Jot down key words and other information that you will need to use later. * To help you focus when you review your notes after the meeting, use bullet points for general information and check boxes for action items. 3. Steer the conversation in the meeting to capture accurate information. If the meeting members seem to have made a decision, clarify what that decision is so you can record it in your notes. * Besides getting clear information for your own notes, steering the conversation towards stating concrete decisions also helps your team identify decisions more quickly, and if there isn’t a clear agreement, it also helps to identify points that need to be discussed further. 4.

Train your combat level. Combat does matter at clan wars. The lower your combat level, the more likely you are going to be targeted by enemy players. Also, it is recommended that you have a high defense level. Defense matters a lot more in team combat than it does in 1 vs 1 pvp. Having high defense along with hitpoints makes it much easier to tank attacks when you are being piled by multiple people and will make it that much easier to stay alive to continue fighting. 2. Avoid being piled no matter what. The worst case scenario is being targeted by the enemy leader. If you see a wave of white dots charging at you and they're calling either your name or combat level, then you are being piled. You can reduce your chances of being piled or targeted by other players if you follow the steps below. 3. Pay attention to the mini-map at all costs. Watch where you are in relation to your teammates and enemies. If there are a swarm of white dots around you and no purple dots around, this is bad. You are setting yourself up to get piled. The best thing to do is to place yourself around other purple dots so your chances of being piled will be minimal. Form a purple cloud on the mini-map with your teammates. Enemies will be less likely to attack anyone in the cloud and if they do, they will be killed soon after. On the other hand, avoid white clouds or attacking anyone in the white cloud. You also have to stay with your group at all costs. If everyone is running north, then you run north. If everyone is piling zezima, you pile zezima as well. Only run away if the enemy has overran the group. In this situation, you should try to find other purple dots and group up with them.  4. Keep your run energy fairly high. If you have your run energy below 45%, then find a safe place and rest. You need to keep your rest energy high because if you are being attacked or piled by enemy players, you will need to be able to get away.  5. If you are being attacked by multiple people, don't just stand there. The best thing to do in this situation is to run into a cloud of purple dots. The reason is because either they will stop attacking you and run away, or be piled and killed by your teammates.	.

Serve foods that were either popular or invented during the 1940s. Wartime food shortages as well as revolutions in food science and manufacturing transformed the way much of the world ate during the 1940s. Consider serving the following foods from the period: * McDonald’s hamburgers * Plain M&Ms * Coney Island Hot Dogs 2. Prepare gourmet recipes that reflect 1940s rationing rules. Most countries implemented strict rationing policies during this period, which meant that cooks had to get creative with food substitutes. If you’re a foodie, research which foods were rationed or in shortage in your country and get creative trying to work around these limitations. * In the Unites States, meat was rationed heavily, so cooks had to try and make organ meats like livers and hearts palatable to diners. 3. Use decorations to make other party foods fit your theme. If you have a favorite party dish that doesn’t fit with the 1940s theme, add decorative flourishes. Decorate a cake to make it look like a national flag, or you can glue small flags to toothpicks and stick them in finger foods. *	.

Define physics as the study of matter in motion. Physics is tough to define and evolves with each new discovery, but roughly explaining what it studies is a good starting point. Tell your students that physics aims to describe the most fundamental, or most basic, aspects of the universe. Physicists try to understand matter and the forces that govern its motion. * Mention that physics is one of the oldest academic fields and stems from humanity’s basic need to understand how the universe works. * You could also bring up the discipline's impacts on human life. Explain that discoveries in physics led to feats from the smartphones in their pockets to nuclear technology. * Connecting physics to basic human drives and discussing its impacts on life can help your students relate to the discipline and its aims. 2. Review the scientific method. Your students have most likely taken other science courses, but it helps to explain how the scientific method works in physics. Start by listing the steps of the scientific method: observation, asking a question, forming a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis, analyzing the data, and forming a conclusion. * Remind your students that a hypothesis attempts to answer the question raised about the phenomenon observed.	.

Start by introducing scalar and vector quantities. Tell your students that describing one-dimensional motion, or motion in 1 direction, is the most basic task in physics. Phrases like “going fast” and “slowing down” describe motion, but they're not very precise. Explain that, in physics, mathematical quantities called scalars and vectors are used to precisely describe an object's motion. * Define scalars as measurements that describe a magnitude alone, such as an object's speed or a distance. Offer examples of scalar quantities, such as a distance of 20 m, a speed of 10 m/s, and a mass of 100 g. Clarify that these numbers are scalars because they don't give information about direction. * In contrast, vectors describe both magnitude and direction, such as a velocity of 40 m/s north, an acceleration of 9.8 m/s downward, or a displacement of 25 m west. * Try rolling a toy car forward, and say, “This car is moving 5 m/s west. Is this a vector or a scalar?” Draw 2 rectangles on the board, connect them with an arrow labeled “10 m,” and say, “This brick has moved 10 m. We don't know the direction in which it has moved. Is this a vector or scalar?” 2. Practice simple formulas by discussing speed and distance. Review that speed and distance are scalar quantities, since they don't give information about direction. Explain that speed is the distance an object has traveled in a given amount of time. Show your students how the formula s = d/t expresses this relationship. * Take a meter-sized step as you count out 1 second. Say, “I traveled 1 meter in 1 second. My speed was 1 meter per second.” * Move a toy car and say, “Speed equals distance over, or divided by, time. Suppose this car has traveled 2 meters in 1 second. Let's fill in the formula s = d/t, so s = 2 m/1 s. The car's speed is 2 m/s. If it traveled 120 m in 3 seconds, s = 120 m/3 s, or 40 m/s.” * Remind students that they can flip the formula around to find other missing variables. If they know the car's constant speed is 2 m/s, and it's been driving for 130 seconds, they can use the formula d = st to find the distance it traveled: d = (2)(130) = 260 m. 3. Teach your students how to determine velocity. Tell your students that velocity is a vector, since it describes an object’s speed and its direction of motion. Move your toy car backward and forward to represent velocity in each direction. On the board, write the formula v = v + at, where v is final velocity, v is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. * If a car’s initial velocity is 4 m/s west, and it accelerates at 3 m/s/s in the same direction for 5 s, its final velocity is (4) + (3)(5), or 19 m/s w. * Emphasize that speed is distance traveled over time, but velocity is the rate at which an object changes its position.	Since your position didn't change in this motion, your velocity is 0 m/s.

Explain that acceleration is the rate of change in velocity over a given period of time. It's a vector, since it gives a motion's direction. Write the equation a = Δv / Δt, on the board, and note that Δv (or v - v) is the change in velocity, and Δt (or t - t) is the amount of time. *	.
Teach_Physics.txt	### Explaining Force, Work, and Energy	If a spring with a spring constant of 10 N / m has been stretched 1 m , its potential energy is ½ ( 10 ) ( 1 ) , or 25 J.	### Explaining Force, Work, and Energy	For example , if a spring with a spring constant of 10 N / m has been stretched 1 m , its potential energy is ½ ( 10 ) ( 1 ) , or 25 J.	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><4>	Explaining Force, Work, and Energy  1. Discuss forces and Newton’s laws. Tell your students that Newton’s laws of motion are the foundation of classical physics. They explain the relationships between an object and the forces that act on it. Mention that, in prior examples, they calculated the car’s linear motion, but now they have to account for the forces that govern how it moves. * The first law of motion, or the law of inertia, states that any object in motion will stay in motion at the same speed and same direction unless another force acts on it. Say, “Imagine a hockey puck rolling over ice. The force of friction slows the puck, so it doesn't travel forever. If the ice were perfectly frictionless, the puck would stay in motion.” * Newton’s second law states that the force acting on an object determines its change in momentum. This law gives us the equation F = m / a, which we can use to find the magnitude of a force. F is force (measured in newtons), m is the object’s mass, and a is its acceleration. * The third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Say, “If a road exerts frictional force on a car’s tires, the car’s tires also exert friction on the road. When you sit on a chair, you exert a downward force on it, and it exerts an upward force on you.” 2. Explain that work is the action of a force. Tell your students that work is what a force does, or how much it moves an object. Work transfers energy from one object to another. Energy is needed in order for one object to move, heat, or affect another. * Write the formula W = Fd cosθ on the board, where W is work, F is force, d is displacement, and cosθ is the cosine of the angle between the force direction and the object’s direction of motion. Mention that the unit of measurement for work is joules, which is 1 newton of force exerted over 1 meter, or 1 N multiplied by 1 m. * Note that if the direction of the force and the direction of the object’s motion are the same, the angle between them is 0°, and the cosine of 0 is 1. * Say, “Suppose a person is pushing a lawn mower at a downward angle of 60° with a force of 900 N, and they’ve pushed the lawn mower 30 m. To calculate work, enter the variables into the equation (write them on the board): W = (900)(30)(cos60°). The cosine of 60° is 0.5, so W = (27,000)(0.5), or 13,500 J.” 3. Show your students how to calculate kinetic energy. Explain that energy is the ability to do work, and there are 2 forms. Tell them potential energy is stored energy, and kinetic energy is the energy of a moving body. For example, if you’re at the top of a hill, you have more potential energy than at the bottom. If you roll down the hill, you convert your potential energy into motion. * As you write the formula on the board, say, “To calculate kinetic energy, which is measured in joules, use the formula KE = ½mv. The m stands for mass and v is velocity. Suppose a bowling ball that weighs 5 kg is rolling at 3 m/s. Plug the variables into the equation to find its kinetic energy: KE = ½(5)(3), or 16 J.” 4. Offer examples of potential energy. Show your students a spring or an elastic band, stretch out, and explain that it's storing elastic potential energy. Tell them a flying object, on the other hand, stores gravitational potential energy. If it falls, it converts this potential energy into kinetic energy. * To calculate elastic potential energy, or energy stored in a spring, write the formula U = ½kx on the board. Explain that k refers to the spring’s stiffness, or its spring constant, and x is how far it’s been stretched.	.

Speak with your doctor before ingesting essential oils. In general, ingesting essential oils such as peppermint oil is not recommended. While the practice is employed in some parts of the world, essential oils are unsafe to consume without professional medical guidance. 2. Ask about enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules if you have IBS. The menthol in peppermint may provide relief from the symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort caused by irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. In order to do so, however, the oil must be delivered to the later part of your digestion system. * In order for the capsules to make it to your intestines, capsules need the protection of an enteric coating, which will help them pass through the stomach without breaking down. * Teas and tinctures that contain peppermint oil will have little to no effect on you IBS symptoms, as the active ingredients they contain will be absorbed before they reach your colon. * Enteric coating will also help reduce potential heartburn, which can be a side effect of taking peppermint oil capsules. 3. Take peppermint oil only when necessary. As soon as you start experiencing symptoms of IBS, which may last for days at a time, take a capsule. Start with one at a time to see if this is enough. Take the capsules daily, for as long as digestive discomfort is bothering you. *	An hour before each meal is ideal.

If the essay is assigned, certain parameters will usually be defined for you, such as the length of the essay, format of the title page, and the intended audience (e.g. your teacher, an admissions committee, a cheating website) and what length is appropriate. No matter what, if you're given directions, follow them. A brilliant essay might still fail to get its point across if it doesn't follow the rules. Remember, the main point is what you should concentrate on. Stick to the question key words throughout your essay. If the question is given and it asks you to describe for example an important character in a novel, you must always refrain from saying an 'interesting character' or 'admirable character'. Stick to the words of the question. 2. 200px|rightChoose a topic. Often this will be decided for you, but if not, try to choose something you're interested in or, better yet, passionate about. It will make the essay easier to write. On the other hand you could choose a stand you disagree with because it will allow you to see flaws in your argument more easily. You can also think of your thesis statement at this point, but it shouldn't be set in stone since it may be elaborated or changed as you do your research in the next step. A thesis statement is what your essay is attempting to explain and prove. Make sure your thesis statement explains everything you will talk about in the essay. It should also be no longer than 1 sentence. You can brainstorm a few different thesis statements and use them to guide your research. Some examples: * I deserve this scholarship because I am going to give back to the community. * Crop failure is directly caused by lack of fertility in soils, not by drought. * Charles Dickens' Hard Times is a social criticism of utilitarianism * Making people take tests before they're allowed to keep pets would decriminalize society in many ways. 3. Gather your information. Whether it's personal observations or scientific facts, you'll need evidence to back up your thesis statement. Take detailed notes, keeping track of which facts come from which sources. As you're researching your topic, don't ignore facts and claims that seem to disprove your thesis statement. A good essayist includes the contrary evidence and shows why such evidence is not valid. * Going with the example about crop failure above, what if you find a research study with graphs showing that every time there's a drought, there are more crop failures? Maybe all those crop failures occurred on farms that had poor soils, and unless the condition of the soils can be provided, the crop failures can't be attributed solely to drought. 4. Plan your essay. This is the time to solidify your thesis statement. Look over all of your research and notes: Can you observe any patterns or observations? Try making a mind map to organize your thoughts. Maybe you started out wanting to show how you'd give back to the community, but now you see a better point would be that you're a good role model for others like yourself. Let the evidence speak for itself. If you don't have enough information to demonstrate anything, you may need to do more research or modify your thesis statement (or even your topic). If you have enough material to sustain a thesis statement, however, make an outline to organize your research with headings and sub-headings. 5. Write the body of your essay first. Identify three or more points that support and/or explain your thesis statement. Each point should be supported by specific evidence, examples or arguments. In shorter essays, such as a five-paragraph essay, each point should be supported by a single paragraph; but in longer essays, an entire page or more might be required to demonstrate a single point. Use your outline as a guide, presenting the information in full sentences that flow logically from one to the next. After you write out all of your points, arrange the points themselves so that they flow logically from one to the next.  * Be careful about generalizing. Statements such as "_____ is the most important problem facing the world today," can cause your reader to dismiss your position out of hand if he/she disagrees with you. On the other hand, "_____ is one of the most important problems facing the world today," is at least a bit harder to argue with. * Be careful not to use 'I statements' such as "I think this..." For most essay topics, your opinions will not be persuasive. Use evidence instead. In college and university, some professors in Liberal Arts or Humanity disciplines (English, History, Sociology, Political Science, etc) do not mind or even encourage their students to use the discursive "I." Some professors argue that it gives the writer ownership over their arguments. Check with your teacher or professor about this. For the most part, however, using the third person is the conventional method. * Unless you are writing a personal opinion piece, you should not need to use the personal pronouns "I" , "you" or "we", nor "my", "your" or "our". If you can't rephrase the statement to remove the first-person pronoun, then you probably don't have enough information to back up your point. E.g. Instead of writing, "I found Frum to be conservatively-biased", show why your statement is true: "Clearly, Frum is conservatively-biased when he writes...". * Note that some writers find the first person useful; however it is not generally recommended that those without significant experience use it. 6. Conclude your essay. Summarize your points and suggest ways in which your conclusion can be thought of in a larger sense. What are the implications of your thesis statement being true? What's the next step? What questions remain unanswered? This is not the place to introduce any new information that supports your thesis--you should only be "repackaging" what you already discussed, using a broader perspective. 7. Write the introduction. Now that you've written the body and the conclusion, you're in the best position to tell the reader what they're getting into. Explain your thesis statement, and how you're going to affirm it, without being too specific. Do not use obvious expressions such as, "This essay is about..." or "The topic of this essay is..." or "I will now show that...". One approach is to begin with a general statement, then follow it with a question or problem, then with your thesis statement, and a brief overview of your points. * Example: Every year, thousands of animals end up in shelters, unwanted and sometimes abused. This not only causes suffering to the animals, but it also costs local governments millions of dollars. Is there any way that this can be prevented? One proposed solution is to require pet-owners to become educated before they can buy a pet. While many people may resist this requirement, it may be more readily accepted if the benefits are clearly shown to outweigh the costs. * For longer essays, it's useful to follow the "inverted pyramid" whereby you start off with a very broad description of your topic and gradually narrow it down to your specific thesis statement. This is the typical structure of a "literature review" in a scientific paper and may constitute up to half, sometimes more, of your essay. 8. Read through your essay. For now, don't worry about typos or grammatical errors; underline them so you can go back and fix them later. Go from start to finish to see how your essay flows. Does each sentence lead smoothly to the next? Does each paragraph flow logically to the next? Each statement should be connected or related somehow to the one before it, not thrown randomly together. There are many ways to transition from one idea to the next: *	.

A good essayist includes the contrary evidence and shows why such evidence is not valid. * Going with the example about crop failure above, what if you find a research study with graphs showing that every time there's a drought, there are more crop failures? Maybe all those crop failures occurred on farms that had poor soils, and unless the condition of the soils can be provided, the crop failures can't be attributed solely to drought. 4. Plan your essay. This is the time to solidify your thesis statement. Look over all of your research and notes: Can you observe any patterns or observations? Try making a mind map to organize your thoughts. Maybe you started out wanting to show how you'd give back to the community, but now you see a better point would be that you're a good role model for others like yourself. Let the evidence speak for itself. If you don't have enough information to demonstrate anything, you may need to do more research or modify your thesis statement (or even your topic). If you have enough material to sustain a thesis statement, however, make an outline to organize your research with headings and sub-headings. 5. Write the body of your essay first. Identify three or more points that support and/or explain your thesis statement. Each point should be supported by specific evidence, examples or arguments. In shorter essays, such as a five-paragraph essay, each point should be supported by a single paragraph; but in longer essays, an entire page or more might be required to demonstrate a single point. Use your outline as a guide, presenting the information in full sentences that flow logically from one to the next. After you write out all of your points, arrange the points themselves so that they flow logically from one to the next.  * Be careful about generalizing. Statements such as "_____ is the most important problem facing the world today," can cause your reader to dismiss your position out of hand if he/she disagrees with you. On the other hand, "_____ is one of the most important problems facing the world today," is at least a bit harder to argue with. * Be careful not to use 'I statements' such as "I think this..." For most essay topics, your opinions will not be persuasive. Use evidence instead. In college and university, some professors in Liberal Arts or Humanity disciplines (English, History, Sociology, Political Science, etc) do not mind or even encourage their students to use the discursive "I." Some professors argue that it gives the writer ownership over their arguments. Check with your teacher or professor about this. For the most part, however, using the third person is the conventional method. * Unless you are writing a personal opinion piece, you should not need to use the personal pronouns "I" , "you" or "we", nor "my", "your" or "our". If you can't rephrase the statement to remove the first-person pronoun, then you probably don't have enough information to back up your point. E.g. Instead of writing, "I found Frum to be conservatively-biased", show why your statement is true: "Clearly, Frum is conservatively-biased when he writes...". * Note that some writers find the first person useful; however it is not generally recommended that those without significant experience use it. 6. Conclude your essay. Summarize your points and suggest ways in which your conclusion can be thought of in a larger sense. What are the implications of your thesis statement being true? What's the next step? What questions remain unanswered? This is not the place to introduce any new information that supports your thesis--you should only be "repackaging" what you already discussed, using a broader perspective. 7. Write the introduction. Now that you've written the body and the conclusion, you're in the best position to tell the reader what they're getting into. Explain your thesis statement, and how you're going to affirm it, without being too specific. Do not use obvious expressions such as, "This essay is about..." or "The topic of this essay is..." or "I will now show that...". One approach is to begin with a general statement, then follow it with a question or problem, then with your thesis statement, and a brief overview of your points. * Example: Every year, thousands of animals end up in shelters, unwanted and sometimes abused. This not only causes suffering to the animals, but it also costs local governments millions of dollars. Is there any way that this can be prevented? One proposed solution is to require pet-owners to become educated before they can buy a pet. While many people may resist this requirement, it may be more readily accepted if the benefits are clearly shown to outweigh the costs. * For longer essays, it's useful to follow the "inverted pyramid" whereby you start off with a very broad description of your topic and gradually narrow it down to your specific thesis statement. This is the typical structure of a "literature review" in a scientific paper and may constitute up to half, sometimes more, of your essay. 8. Read through your essay. For now, don't worry about typos or grammatical errors; underline them so you can go back and fix them later. Go from start to finish to see how your essay flows. Does each sentence lead smoothly to the next? Does each paragraph flow logically to the next? Each statement should be connected or related somehow to the one before it, not thrown randomly together. There are many ways to transition from one idea to the next: * one happens before or after the other:I first started to realize that I was in the minority when I was in middle school...My realization was confirmed when I proceeded to high school. * one elaborates on the other:Plants need water to survive...A plant's ability to absorb water depends on the nutrition of the soil. * one contrasts with the other: Vegetarians argue that land is unnecessarily wasted by feeding animals to be eaten as food...Opponents argue that land being used for grazing would not be able to be used to create any other kind of food. *	.

Understand_Your_Teenage_Daughter.txt	## Steps	Talk to her about certain restrictions .	## Steps	Also , talk to her about certain restrictions .	<insert><Also><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Talk><1><talk><3>	Steps  1. Understand that she needs independence. As a parent, you want to make all her decisions, tell her when to do her homework, tell her how to do everything. But you need to back off. "So you just want me to stop being her parent?" No, not exactly. When a girl reaches the age of 13, they start asking questions, and start wanting to find who they truly are and why they are. It's our goal to support them in that. Not tell them what to do, yes in some cases you can tell them what to do. please do not abuse these powers. Support them, love them, and let them make as many mistakes as possible. 2. Know that she doesn't hate. No, she doesn't hate you. It may seem like your teen hates you, maybe because she actually says it a few times a day, but don't take it to heart, and learn how to improve on why she hates you 3. Understand their feelings on how much control they want from you. They don't want control. Usually when our teens question what we tell them, our brains put the wrong "Twos in twos" together and we think "She wants to be my boss!" But that is not true. Her brain is developing and she is going through very hard times, and as it develops into it's adult stage, they question everything. That is what is supposed to happen, so don't try to completely stop it. 4. Understand that taking things away is not the answer. In a young girl when you take something away from them, they realize "Oh i shouldn't do that again" But as they get older, their brains function differently, and they learn things differently. They feel like they are a kid again when you take things away. Doing things that way, will trigger an instant defense and hate towards you when you do. * "If I can't take things away then how do I punish her?" Easy, You don't. For teens, they learn much better when you react to the situation and respond to what actually happened, instead of, "They stayed out too late, so you're taking away their phone". What does their phone have to do with staying out too late? Talk to her! Ask her why she stayed out too late. Teens also have bad memories so they might have truly forgotten what time it really was. And if they didn't forget, or it's obvious that they are lying, make the time they need to come home at 9 instead of 10. 5. Be careful how you treat your daughter, if they don't have the right respect and the right independence and support, and the right parenting, then it could lead to depression, teen suicide, or a brain disorder. It is extremely important to respect your daughter so that she will respect you. You can't expect her to respect you just for the fact that you are her parent. You need to show her what respect is first, and you must do that by giving her your respect. Additionally, when you get it in your head that the way your teen is acting is rebellion, then you get mad at her and cause her EXTRA stress and emotional hurt and that is the VERY last thing your teenage daughter needs. Teenagers are already very emotional, insecure, and dealing with the pressures and struggles of growing up, discovering who they are and want to be, and dealing with school life and friends. 6. Be careful how you judge your daughter. She's already being judged. And look at how your own life is; Emotional abuse could be coming from your lips without even realizing it. Tell your daughter she is beautiful just the way she is, since the media and her own insecure thoughts are telling her otherwise.  7. Tap into her personal life. Get to know her. Maybe you know what stuffed animal she loved as a small kid or where her old dollhouse is, but she's growing up now, she's changing and she's into different things now. Some parents can't face up to that, you know. Let her know that you aren't just a nagging parent that just wants her to finish the grade and not party all night during the summer. Let her know that you want the best for her. Let her think of you as a friend she can confide in, a buddy she won't be embarrassed to go shopping with, a person who truly loves her. 8. Talk to her. Don't just ask her how her day was right when she gets home from school. All she will say is "good" when maybe she got bullied, got an F on a test or maybe even lost a friend. She just might not want to share it. A girl who won't tell you what's bugging her or what she doesn't like about herself means she either finds you annoying to talk to or that she doesn't trust you completely. Just talk to her and tell her that you are there to help. Don't make it sound like you are trying to be overprotective and that you want to know everything. She has a personal life that she sometimes just can't let out right away. Just be patient. 9. Give her more responsibilities. If you restrict her from too many things, she will think that you don't trust her and you are being unfair.	Let some restrictions be less restrictive. Like say, you won't let your daughter wear shorts that are two inches above her knees or higher. Make it four instead. Make sure she doesn't break that rule and when you fully trust her, move it to six. Do the same thing with other rules. Soon your daughter will think you're cooler and that you aren't making restrictions for fun.

Look at what you listen to daily. Make sure you actually listen to metal on a daily basis. Listening to a few metal songs at a friend's house or on a game doesn't make you a metalhead. If you use a software to play music, you can easily check what you’ve listened to by date and how many times you've listened to a song. * You should have at least a couple tracks from a metal band in your recently played playlist. 2. Know classic metal. There are “godfathers” of metal that you should know, if you consider yourself a metalhead. There are also several bands that fall on the line of metal and classic rock. The reality of the situation is that genres are malleable and shouldn’t be taken as a strict label. Some of the classic rock/metal bands are Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Van Halen, and Iron Maiden. Other classic metal bands are: * Metallica * Megadeath * Slayer * Death * Judas Priest * Pantera 3. Understand the sub-genres. Make sure you know a few bands of every subgenre of metal. Just a few major metal subgenres are thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal and speed metal. Many metalheads consider adolescents who listen “mallcore” and claim to be metalheads to be posers. * Mallcore includes bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Of Mice and Men, and Motionless in White. * A list of a few bands and their respective subgenres are in the tips section. 4. Learn some metal facts. Know random trivia about bands like Motorhead, Metallica, Pantera, Death, Iron Maiden, Children of Bodom, and any other band you like. Statements like "Slipknot Sucks!" or "Mastodon is the only good metal band" are typical statements from a metalhead poser. If you only like one band, you don't like metal. *	If a person likes Metallica and has only listened to Metallica, then he or she can still be considered a genuine metalhead, but an adolescent metalhead to say the least.

Before you write a single thing down, you should have a clear idea about what this speech is meant to accomplish. Write down the purpose of your speech at the top of the page. 2. Determine your audience. It could be work colleagues, classmates, a hobby group etc. It's worth thinking about various aspects of the audience, because this will determine various aspects of your speech, such as its length, its tone, ect. Think about how big the audience will be, what the age range will be like, and why the audience has gathered. 3. Brainstorm on what important things to include. If the speech is a general introduction of yourself, include things like where you're from, how you ended up here in this group, what your passions and interests are, and what you hope to get out of this event or group. If this is work-related speech, it would be wise to include things like your own qualifications and important skills, things that bolster your credibility and reason for being there. Ultimately it's up to you to decide what topics and ideas should make up your speech. 4. Tailor your content to your audience and purpose.	What is it about you that you think people would want to know? What kind of information are they expecting? Ask yourself these questions and then decide how the answers will inform the content of your speech.

Specifically, does your marketing get the attention and interest of prospects? Are you converting enough of those prospects into clients? * The results of your market research are summarized in a market report.

These changes can help you get more business from the time and money you spend on marketing. 2. Evaluate your customer’s problem, and how well your product solves that problem.

Reach beyond your comfort zone. If you’re living within your comfort zone, know that there’s a lot of life you’re missing. Some indicators of living within your comfort zone include feeling bored, restless, tired, dissatisfied, and lacking enthusiasm for life. The good news is that it doesn’t have to stay this way! Find ways to do things that feel uncomfortable. Do the things you’ve never done but always wanted to do. Think about what scares you, then go tackle it. Remember that you’ve already tackled many fears in your life, and that you are capable of tackling whatever is in front of you. Don’t let fear hold you back. * It’s hard to get over the fear of stepping out of what feels comfortable. Take some baby steps, start small and celebrate your successes. Get inspired by other people who have stepped out of their comfort zone and thrived, then know that you can do it, too! * Staying within your comfort zone in fear of embarrassment limits and deprives your life of the fun you can experience. Step out of it with courage and boldness; who cares what others think of you? Be yourself, and do what you want. * Check out How to Step Out of Your Comfort Zone for more tips. 2. Be present. Mindfulness practices encourage being in the present moment, benefitting well being, and your physical and mental health. This means engaging your senses and observing your thoughts without judgment. Feel the ground beneath you when you walk, listen to the sounds around you, taste each bite of food you eat, engage your sense of smell, and observe your surroundings with your eyes. Use your senses to the fullest instead of letting them run on autopilot. Then, practice mindfulness on your thoughts and emotions,consciously observing each without judgment. * When you taste food, devote your thought processes to the food. Take a moment to smell the food, and notice how your body reacts to the smell. Then, put the food in your mouth, being sure not to chew yet. Observe the texture and the flavors. As you begin to chew, notice how it feels between your teeth and on your tongue. * Notice when you become distracted, and bring yourself back to the moment with your senses. Let your thoughts take a break and engage with your environment. 3. Give gratitude. It’s time for you to move the Thanksgiving turkey aside and get in the practice giving thanks daily. Grateful people exhibit health and happiness benefits, such as sleeping better, having increased empathy and decreased aggression, improved self-esteem, and improved physical and psychological health. * Begin and end each day by observing 3 things you are grateful for. Connect with the feeling of gratitude, don’t list things you have. The less material your focus, the better. Be grateful for your friends, for the ability to walk to the market, and the feeling of the sun on your shoulders. 4. Have a good attitude. Always look on the positive side of all situations, no matter what! Even if the situation seems entirely negative, there has got to be some positive in it, big or small. A good attitude will help you get through many of life’s difficulties. Having a positive outlook is associated with health and psychological benefits, such as lower rates of depression and distress and having a longer lifespan. * When you notice negative thoughts, observe them, then choose to think of something positive. For instance, combat thoughts like, “I’ll mess this up, I’ve never done it before!” with “I am so proud of myself for trying something new and giving myself the opportunity to try something new.” * If you’ve really embarrassed yourself and feel like your life is over, tell yourself, “Everything will pass and eventually blow over. Britney Spears shaved her head once, and nobody seems to care about that anymore, so nothing will follow me forever.” 5. Avoid perfectionism. Remember that what feels perfect lasts only moments. Don’t cheat yourself out of a happy life by trying to make it ‘perfect’, because an entirely perfect life in unattainable (and probably unenjoyable). Perfectionism can create unhappiness and an inability to celebrate your successes as not being “good enough”. Perfectionists can fall in a trap of having a fear of failure or a fear of taking risks. *	It can be terrifying to speak a foreign language, but accept that you will make mistakes and learn from them. Improvement often requires risk, and it’s okay to make mistakes!

Getting an airplane ticket and Finding a hotel are all that you need before going to Bali. That's all you have to do in Korea except pack your luggage.

Focus on economics in high school. You can start your education on economics in high school by taking classes. Most schools offer at least one course in economics, and many offer more classes. If your school doesn't, see if you can take classes at a local community college, as many schools allow you to take classes concurrently. * Even if you don't want to be an economics major in college, learning economics can help you be more financially literate and better understand how a capitalist society functions. 2. Begin with the introductory courses at university. While most programs already require you to do so, it's a good idea to start with the basics. Get the introductory classes out of the way first, so that you have a foundation for later classes. * For instance, you'll likely start with a course on beginning microeconomics and one on beginning macroeconomics. You may also want to take a course on the history of economics or an introduction to microeconomics. 3. Take a wide range of courses in economics. When you're first starting out in economics, try to pick a range of classes. Eventually, you'll likely want to specialize in an area, but it's difficult to choose an area of study if you haven't been exposed to the wide range of subjects in the field. * Keep in mind that you don't want to focus solely on economics classes. For instance, history classes are ideal for an economics major, as economics influenced the course of history in a large way. Many "new worlds" were discovered due to the desire for new goods and trade routes, for instance. * Similarly, computer skills are important. Much of what economists do today is integrated with computers, so if you're looking to become an economist, your computer skills need to be sharp. Take classes on contemporary computer software, for instance. 4. Become a math expert in calculus and statistics. Economics is heavily math-based, so take classes that will help you build a strong foundation in math. Statistics is an especially relevant course, so try to take that if you can. As you advance, you'll likely need to take several semesters of calculus, so make sure you get in the prerequisites you need before moving onto calculus. 5. Combine economics with another degree. Economics is great on its own, but it can also be beneficial to do a double major. Economics can be applied to almost any other field, so you can work on it with another field you enjoy. 6. Practice independent work as you move towards graduation. As you advance in your degree, you'll need to work more and more on your own. Start this process by working on being independent early on. Try to work through problems on your own so you better understand the course material, for instance. Once you graduate, you'll be on your own at a job or moving on to more independent education in graduate school, so being able to think on your own is important. * For instance, don't just blindly do your homework.	Tweak them, and try to figure out how they work. Challenge yourself to come up with interesting solutions to questions rather than a standard answer. Economics is about learning to think for yourself, not just popping out a standard answer.
Tell_if_a_Function_Is_Even_or_Odd.txt	### Method One: Using Algebra	This function is neither even nor odd .	### Testing the Function Algebraically	Therefore , this function is neither even nor odd .	<insert><Therefore><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><This><1><this><3>	Method One: Using Algebra  1. Plug -x into the original function. Look at the original function and locate the x variable. Each time you see x in the function, replace it with -x. * Example A: f(x) = 4x - 7 * f(-x) = 4(-x) - 7 * Example B: f(x) = 5x - 2x * f(-x) = 5(-x) - 2 (-x) * Example C: f(x) = 7x + 5x + 3 * f(-x) = 7(-x) + 5(-x) + 3 2. Solve the equation. Evaluate the equation by applying your knowledge of exponents and standard multiplication to get rid of any unnecessary negative signs. * Example A: f(-x) = 4(-x) - 7 * A negative exponent multiplied by itself an even number of times will produce a positive. This goes back to the mathematical principle that two negatives equal a positive in terms of multiplication. * f(-x) = 4(x) - 7 * Example B: f(-x) = 5(-x) - 2 (-x) * A negative exponent multiplied by itself an odd number of times will result in a negative. Additionally, a negative sign before an exponent will need to be multiplied with the plus or minus sign that comes before it, and a negative sign multiplied by a subtraction sign will result in a plus sign. * f(-x) = -5x + 2x * Example C: f(-x) = 7(-x) + 5(-x) + 3 * Again, look at the exponents, as well as the plus and minus signs. Even exponents will result in a positive x and odd exponents result in a negative x. A negative sign multiplied by a plus sign will turn the plus into a minus sign, and vice versa. * f(-x) = 7x - 5x + 3 3. Analyze the results. If your end function is the same as your starting function, the function is even. If the end result is the opposite or negative of your starting function, the function is odd. If neither is true, the function is neither even nor odd. * In an even function, both the starting and ending functions must be the exact same. * In an odd function, all of the plus signs must become minus signs and all of the minus signs must become plus signs. * When written in algebraic symbols: * For an even function: f(x) = f(-x) * For an odd function: f(-x) = -f(x) * For neither: f(-x) ≠ f(x); f(-x) ≠ -f(x) * Example A: f(x) = 4x - 7 * f(-x) = 4(x) - 7 * This function is even. * Note, also, that each x in an even function will typically have a positive exponent. * Example B: f(x) = 5x - 2x * f(-x) = -5x + 2x * This function is odd. * Generally, each portion of the function will need to be accompanied by an x with an odd exponent for the function itself to be odd. * Example C: f(x) = 7x + 5x + 3 * f(-x) = 7x - 5x + 3 *	.
Understand_Your_Digital_SLR.txt	## Steps	Try setting your camera into fully manual mode (M) to see the effect of the aperture on light .	## Steps	So try setting your camera into fully manual mode (M) to see the effect of the aperture on light .	<insert><So><1>|||<replace><Try><1><try><2>	Steps  1. Look for a subject. We're going to be taking photographs at a wide range of settings, so it's important that you don't take photographs of anything too dark. Remember that human sight can perceive a much wider range of light intensities than a digital camera sensor (which is referred to as the camera's dynamic range). We can look through a window and still see what is inside at the same time, even though the light conditions inside are totally different from these outdoors. Cameras, and especially digital cameras, can not. So on camera, you will only see what's outside through the window or what's inside. Consider this when picking your subject. 2. Put your camera onto something. If you have a tripod, use one; if you have a solid surface to rest on, then do so. Not that a tripod is as necessary as many people say it is; but to observe the effects of various camera settings, it's best if you get several shots of exactly the same thing. 3. Set your camera to Program (P) mode. 4. Play with your camera's ISO speed. This will be the first camera setting that you will experiment with. You can set this in the camera's menus; many cameras will allow you to change this with a couple of button presses, too. The ISO speed is a measure of your camera's sensor's sensitivity to light; a lower number is less sensitive, and a higher number is more sensitive. Take a photo of your subject at its lowest ISO speed (or "slowest", typically 50, 100 or 200), and then take one at its highest (800, 1600 or more). Observe the following: * The photo taken with the slower ISO speed will have forced the camera to use a slower shutter speed (which we'll get to later on), while the photo taken with the faster ISO speed would have used a faster shutter speed. The difference between the two may have been significant enough to be audible. Being able to use a faster shutter speed means that you can, for example, freeze motion (and, similarly, avoid camera shake) in poorer light than you could with a slower one. * The photo taken with the slower ISO speed will have less noise (random discoloured pixels) than the one taken with a faster ISO speed (although digital SLRs, owing to their larger sensors, have much better high-ISO performance than small point-and-shoot digital cameras do). Hence, you're left with a trade-off between image quality and usability in low-light conditions. At a concert, for example, a higher ISO speed may well be more appropriate; in bright daylight, or when you're using a tripod and remote release, lower ISO speeds may be more appropriate. 5. Set your camera to aperture-priority mode for a moment. We'll get around to exactly what this means in a second. This will usually be called "Av" (for Aperture value) on your mode dial. 6. Set your lens' aperture (also called the diaphragm). This will be a dial on your lens with a series of numbers on it (which will typically fall anywhere between 1.4 and 22 on most lenses). The diaphragm is just that: a diaphragm towards the front of your lens that lets more or less light onto the sensor. The size of the diaphragm is expressed as a ratio of focal length to aperture size (hence, they are referred to as, for example, f/5.6); consequently, a smaller aperture (more light onto your sensor) is expressed by a larger number. So, take two photographs, one with a larger aperture, and then stop down and take one with a smaller aperture. Observe: * The background of your subject is less sharp with a larger aperture than it is with the smaller one. This is called the depth of field. So, if you want to make a subject stand out from the background, use a large aperture to blur the background; if you need to get more of your scene in focus, use a larger aperture. * The smaller aperture let less light onto the sensor than the larger one would have, forcing the camera to compensate for this by using a slower shutter speed. This is what "aperture priority" exposure control is about. Usually the camera will adjust either the aperture or the shutter speed to get the right amount of light onto the sensor; Av mode forces the aperture to take priority and the camera will only adjust the shutter speed.	.
Train_Your_Service_Dog_Without_a_Professional_Trainer.txt	## Steps	Teach your dog to take no note of cats , food on the ground , a stranger talking to the dog or vehicles ( especially moving vehicles ) .	### Training Your Service Dog	In addition , teach your dog to take no note of cats , food on the ground , a stranger talking to the dog or vehicles ( especially moving vehicles ) .	<insert><In><1>|||<insert><addition><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Teach><1><teach><4>	Steps  1. Find out if your dog has the potential to become a service dog. A large percentage of all puppies are capable of becoming a service dog but ask yourself these questions: * Is your dog comfortable in every thinkable situation? * Can your dog cope with all kinds of people and dogs, at best even all kinds of animals? * Is your dog non-aggressive and non-protective? 2. Neuter or spay your dog. Do this between four and six months of age. All service dogs are neutered because neutered dogs are less likely to drift to find females in heat, they are also less likely to mark territory and they are less likely to develop more territorial tendencies. Neutered dogs are less aggressive, which is an important factor for a service dog. * Depending on the weight of your dog, a neutering costs between USD$200 and USD$300 at most vets. 3. Train basic obedience. A service dog has to be able to sit, stay, lie down and come on cue 90 percent of the time the handler asks him to do so. You can use either verbal cues or hand signals as commands. The dog also needs to walk next to the handler in a controlled manner all the time. * The best way to teach your dog specific behavioral traits is clicker training. * If you have no clue how to teach your dog sit, stay, lie down, come and heel, you should not train your own service dog. 4. Teach the dog to be as well-behaved unleashed as leashed. The dog should do the basic obedience tricks when no leash is on. 5. Teach your dog not to greet other people. The service dog has to be focused on you, and not on anyone else. This step is vitally important because you may need instant help, and if the dog is running around to other people to greet them, the dog can miss your need for immediate help. 6. Train a little agility with the dog. It improves courage and stability, and is a good way to see how well your dog listens to commands. 7. Socialize your dog a lot. Socializing doesn't just mean going to new places – it also includes meeting plenty of new people and animals. * If you can't talk to people for any particular reason, have a vest on the dog that says: "Please pet me", or "Let me meet your dog", and also "I'm training to become a service dog" if you want to add that. * Since you have taught the dog not to greet other people, say "greet" or whatever word you have taught the dog and ensure that the greet word means that the dog is allowed to greet another person. 8.	The one and only thing that the dog is supposed to care about is you.

Determine the type of frog you have. The most common aquatic frogs are the African dwarf frog and the African clawed frog. Their care requirements are the same, but the clawed frog should not share the aquarium with other species. You can easily house dwarf frogs along with small aquarium fish or shrimp. * Dwarf frogs have webbed fingers on their front legs. * Clawed frogs have no webbing on their front feet. * Dwarf frogs are under in length, whereas clawed frogs can reach a size of as adults. * Although you should never release any pet into the wild, this is especially true for clawed frogs. They are extremely predatory, invasive species. 2. Choose appropriate housing for your frog. It will need a tank of a size that allows it move around with ease. For one aquatic frog, you will need 10 gallons (38 L) of water at least deep. * Aquatic frogs, especially dwarf frogs, are not particularly strong swimmers, but they do need to come up to the surface of the water to breathe regularly. Anything deeper than will make it too difficult for your frog to surface. * If you have more than one frog, you will need a minimum of 1 gallon (3.8 L) per frog. The more space the better. If the tank is crowded, it will not only stress your frogs, but it will also mean you will have to clean the water more often. 3. Install a tank cover with no openings. Aquatic frogs like to jump. If there are any openings in the top of your tank, they may jump out of your tank. Aquatic frogs really are fully aquatic, so they will die if they are outside their water habitat for more than 15-20 minutes. * Even small openings in the tank lid for filters or air lines may be big enough for your frog to hop through. Be sure you get a lid that has covers for any unused holes, or buy the covers separately. * Some aquarium covers come with plastic on the back side where you can cut small openings for any wires or tubing that needs to go into the tank. Cut the holes so they fit the wires or tubes very snugly so the frogs won’t be able to get out that way. 4. Give your frogs a variety of hiding places. Aquatic frogs feel more happy and secure if they have somewhere to hide. Use aquarium decorations or shelters specifically designed for aquatic frogs. You can also use live plants or soft artificial ones. * Try using unpainted clay flower pots lying on their side in the tank. This is a perfect hiding place for your frogs, and it’s an easy and budget-friendly solution for you. * Don’t use anything in the tank that is painted or glazed. Some of the chemicals can leach out into the water and poison your frogs. 5. Add a standard aquarium light. Aquatic frogs don’t need fancy basking lights like reptiles do.	You can buy a regular aquarium light and a timer. Set the timer to give the frogs 10 hours of light per day.

Choose a productive work space. Working in your dorm or bedroom may be convenient, but it often isn't the most productive environment. Instead of risking being distracted by things like television, video games, or internet browsing, try working in a more conducive work space like the library or a coffee shop. * Choose a work space that gets you out of your room and away from distractions as much as possible. * Turn off your cellphone before you start working. Getting texts or social media notifications will only distract you and delay your paper. * If you need to be alone to work efficiently, don't invite any other friends to work at a shared location. It may be fun to work with friends, but it will only further prolong your work and keep you from focusing on the task at hand. 2. Know what's expected of you. Depending on your instructor's teaching style, you may have been given a lot of detailed instruction or you may have been given very little guidance. Either way, you'll need to know what your instructor expects out of your work if you want to meet those expectations. * Try to determine how many paragraphs you'll need. The standard model for an academic paper is to have five main paragraphs: the introduction, three body paragraphs, and the conclusion. * If your paragraphs end up being under-developed and too brief to fill two pages, you may need to include more paragraphs or build off of the paragraphs you have. *	Your instructor may expect you to have a minimum number of citations, and while you can always exceed that number (though not by too much in a two-page paper), you'll want to at least have the bare minimum.
