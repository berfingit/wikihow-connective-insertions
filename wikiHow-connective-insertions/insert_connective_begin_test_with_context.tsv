Decide what kind of cat to get. Do you want a pedigreed cat or a "moggie," the cat word for mutt? Pedigreed cats are beautiful, but they often come with health problems. Moggies aren't purebred but they are less expensive to adopt and have fewer health and personality issues. * If you're interested in a pedigreed cat, research reputable breeders and be sure to get confirmation that the cat is coming from someone with plenty of experience in genetics and breeding. * Since the parentage of moggies isn't usually known, it's important to make sure they are tested for diseases upon adoption. 2. Decide what age the cat will be. Adopting a kitten can be a lot of fun, but it also takes a lot more work than adopting a cat. Kittens are full of energy and aren't yet independent, while cats can usually fend for themselves pretty well, and their presence tends to be more serene. * If your family has very young children or babies, it's not a good idea to adopt a kitten, since kittens should never be handled roughly. * Consider adopting a cat on the older side if you are a senior yourself. Older cats tend to get overlooked at shelters, but they usually make excellent companions later in life. 3. Decide between getting a male or a female cat. Males and females have different behavioral tendencies before they are neutered or spayed, so if you're not planning on having your cat fixed, the sex is something to keep in mind. However, due to the prevalence of stray cats and for the sake of your cats' health and happiness, it is highly recommended that you spay or neuter your cat. Once male or female cats have have been fixed, their personalities and behavior aren't very different. The male and female sexes have an equal chance of being sweet, friendly, excitable, or difficult. 4. Consider getting more than one. Many cats love each others' company. If you adopt two cats, you won't have to worry about one being bored or lonely while you're not there.	If you have the space in your home and the financial resources to get more than one, this is something to strongly consider.

Check out local shelters or get in touch with a breeder. If you want to get a pedigreed cat, set up an appointment with a breeder to get the process started. The more common route cat owners take is to look for cats is at local rescue shelters. If you're not concerned about getting a pedigreed cat, a rescue shelter is a great place to look. Shelter staff will be knowledgeable about their cats and kittens, and they'll be able to help you find a pet that will be a good fit with your family. * Use www.petfinder.com to browse pets available in local shelters online. You'll be able to see pictures and read descriptions before you meet the cats in person. * Pet stores are another option for getting a new cat. Since pet stores often get their kittens and puppies from unethical sources, this is not recommended. * Many people also post about kittens and cats available for adoption on classifieds sites and in newspapers. This path is often very affordable, but you're always taking a risk adopting a cat from an individual, since you can't be sure of the cat's history and origins. 2. Get acquainted with several cats. After you've done some research, it's time to get to know your potential pet. Visit with the cats you're interested in to determine if your personalities are a good match. Consider what type of cat you think would work well in your home situation. *	You should be able to tell right away whether a cat will enjoy being petted or sitting in your lap.

Be_a_Great_Camp_Counselor.txt	## Steps	If you run around calling Jane by Brittany 's name and vice versa , you will lose their respect and they will feel hurt that they are not important enough to know your name .	## Steps	For example , if you run around calling Jane by Brittany 's name and vice versa , you will lose their respect and they will feel hurt that they are not important enough to know your name .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><4>	Steps  1. Know what the job entails. Being a counselor is a very draining experience. You will NOT get eight hours of sleep a night, you will NOT get to take a shower everyday and you will NOT be able to complain about it (at least not to the kids). If you can smile through these and spend your days giving kids one of the greatest week of their lives, then read on. If not, you really must evaluate why you want to be a counselor. It's a lot of fun, but a lot of work. It is not a week of being a camper, for older kids! You must be responsible, and able to handle any situation that comes up. 2. Prepare. Take a CPR class, or train to be a lifeguard. Most likely, you will need to know how to do CPR to complete counselor training. Go camping if it is a wilderness camp. You will most likely need to know how to pitch a tent and start a fire. If you know activities that are taught at camp that you don't know much about, research it! This will make training so much easier, and make you invaluable in that you will be able to handle anything. 3. Pay attention in training. Most camps offer a training period, during which you will learn everything about how the camp is run, and emergency procedure. It's very easy to tune out, DON'T! You never know when you will need it again. When little Jimmy collapses on a hike, you don't want to be thinking to yourself "I wish I had been paying attention to the lecture instead of watching that squirrel" 4. Become friends with the other counselors. You don't all have to be best friends forever, but it is essential that you all get along, at the minimum. If counselors are arguing, even if its done far outside earshot of the campers, they will pick up on it. Most likely, you will have to work even a little bit with all of the other counselors, everything goes smoother if you are friends. You don't want to find out later in the summer that you are leading a cabin with the counselor you hate. 5. Memorize the camp schedule. You will want to know what is going on next, and which day they serve waffle-sticks. If you are constantly checking the schedule when the campers ask what is happening next, they will think that you are incompetent and you will lose their respect. 6. Get to know your campers names.	Play name games, if it helps you.
Build_a_Large_Pond.txt	## Steps	there should be room in the Pond to hold a heavy Rain event or it may overfill Pond as well and cause flooding .	## Steps	Moreover there should be room in the Pond to hold a heavy Rain event or it may overfill Pond as well and cause flooding .	<insert><Moreover><1>	Steps  1. Select the site and basic shape outline of the pond. Call 811 Digline to notify of excavation to Locate any buried utilities. Even hand digging one can hit and damage things like Telephone, Cable lines etc. Wait for Locate to be finished before any digging begins. 2. Consider electric power supply if planning on using an Electric powered Pump system. It will need to be on a GFI (Ground Fault Interrupted) Breaker in the Electrical Panel or a GFI plug in near the Pump location. Also, consider if any Pond underwater or Pond edge low voltage night lighting is to be installed. THIS MUST BE 100% WATERPROOF CONNECTIONS! CONSULT AND\OR HIRE LICENSED ELECTRICIAN There is a variety of Solar Powered Pumps on the market and be sure the Pump will meet or exceed the Pumping requirements you are wanting to achieve. 3. Circulate all the water in the Pond at least twice in an hour. There is nothing more unsightly or displeasing than a dirty, smelly Pond in the yard. 4. Clear the "pond area" from anything that is on top of it. Branches, leaves, grass, everything must go. 5. Mark outline of pond shape edges using Marking Paint, a rope or even a Garden Hose will work. Start digging rough outline edges first so that the outline will be established. Pay special attention to drainage and overflow flooding when choosing the location. 6. Dig the hole. It can be as deep as you want but recommend to do it not so deep, because it will look dark and not as shiny, but everyone has his/her own likes/dislikes. 7. It's recommended that the pond be fairly shallow in case a small child or pet gets into the pond and be able to get out or stand in it. Plan on digging shelves in the side walls all the way around the pond to not only aid a child, pet or even an Adult in getting out but the shelf will also provide plant ledges and Gravel\Rock bottom placement. 8. During excavation a water level below the Pond edge will have to be established not only for Pond water level during use but for any type of filtration to be used such as a 'Skimmer' style inlet. Also if a Waterway\Waterfall is built into Pond there needs to be enough room in the Pond to hold the water that is being pumped down Waterway for holding purposes or it will overfill the Pond when shut off causing flooding. Also.	Consideration of flooding and drainage is also to be taken into design considerations.

Build_a_Kegerator.txt	## Steps	Make sure that the keg is sealed and ready to be pressurized .	## Steps	Also make sure that the keg is sealed and ready to be pressurized .	<insert><Also><1>|||<replace><Make><1><make><2>	Steps  1. Understand the basic functions and components of a kegerator. A kegerator is essentially a keg of beer that is kept cold in a refrigerator. The refrigerator has a beer tap or faucet protruding from it, from which the beer is dispensed. The beer is forced through the faucet from the keg by forcing carbon dioxide into the keg. A small tank of carbon dioxide is used to supply the gas pressure, and maintain a specific pressure in the keg so that beer can be dispensed evenly at any time. A regulator that is attached to the gas cylinder enables one to regulate the pressure. There is vinyl "gas" tubing that goes from the gas cylinder and regulator to the "in" port of the keg. From the "out" port of the keg there is the "beer" or "beverage" line, more vinyl tubing that goes to the beer faucet. 2. Obtain the necessary components. The components will be somewhat variable, depending on the type of beer that is to be dispensed, and number and types of kegs that will be on tap at one time. The components generally include: One refrigerator large enough to contain the type of keg(s) that will be utilized, beer faucet(s) and handle, faucet shank, wing nut with washer and tailpiece to attach the shank to the beverage tubing (if not already part of the shank), beverage and gas line connectors or coupler for type of keg that is to be used, fasteners such as worm clamps for the tubing, CO2 tank, CO2 gas regulator, and appropriately sized vinyl tubing. 3. Attach the regulator to the CO2 tank (empty or full, but read all instructions and warnings for these components first!), and place (do not actually attach) the beverage and gas connectors or coupler on top of the keg. This will enable the actual dimensions of the keg and gas hardware to be determined. Do not attach the keg connectors or coupler to a full, pressurized keg, as this may cause beer and gas to be released from the keg under high pressure. Do not attach the actual tubing yet. 4. Fit the keg and gas hardware in the refrigerator in preparation for faucet and shank placement and installation. The refrigerator may be crowded, so make sure that the faucet and beverage line will not be impeded by the other components. It is customary to place the gas hardware in the refrigerator with the keg, although this is not necessary. However, an additional hole will have to be drilled for the gas line if the gas hardware is placed outside the refrigerator. 5. Choose an area of the refrigerator that can be safely drilled through in order to place the faucet shank. Refrigerators have internal components that must be completely avoided. It is generally easiest and safest to drill a hole though the refrigerator door. 6. Draw a circle or make a centered dot where you want to drill a hole in the refrigerator for the shank and faucet assembly. Remove the keg and gas hardware from the refrigerator. Make sure the refrigerator is unplugged. 7. Obtain a hole saw drill bit that will produce a hole that will neatly accommodate the faucet shank, and drill a hole. Account for the thickness of the refrigerator. Refrigerators tend to be quite easy to drill though. 8. Clean up all debris that was produced from the hole drilling. 9. Clean and sanitize beer faucet, shank, beer line, and other associated components. Anything that comes in contact with the beer should be clean and sanitized. 10. Insert the beer faucet and shank assembly through the refrigerator, and secure using included hardware. Attach the beer line to the connector or coupler that attaches it to the keg, and attach the beer line to the faucet shank tailpiece. Secure both ends of the tubing with worm clamps or similar hardware. All beverage and gas lines must be completely secured so that beer and gas leaks to not result. The beer line should be at least five feet in length in order to reduce beer foam. 11. Make sure that the CO2 cylinder is filled, completely shut off, and properly attached to the gas regulator. The regulator must also be completely shut off and set to zero pressure. Obtain about three feet or more of vinyl gas tubing. Securely attach the the gas line to the regulator outlet and to the keg gas line "in" connector. Double check to make sure that the gas cylinder outlet is shut off, and that the regulator is closed so that gas cannot escape. 12. Obtain a chilled keg of beer. Vent off all gas pressure in the keg by pulling a pressure relief valve on the keg. 13. Connect the gas line to the keg. Keep the gas turned off. 14. Connect the beer line to the keg. 15. Make sure that all connections are secure, and that the beer tap handle is in the closed position. 16. Make sure that the gas regulator is set to zero and the safety shutoff is closed, so that gas cannot escape. Turn the main CO2 cylinder gas valve on, keeping the gas regulator off so that gas still cannot escape through the gas line.	Open the regulator shutoff and very very slowly adjust the regulator to about 10PSI, letting the gas enter the keg. Listen for any hissing sounds that may indicate that gas is leaking from somewhere in the system (there should not be any leaks).

Get a job. Having your own job builds positive character and can help you mature. Even if parents give you money, earning your own paycheck puts you on a path to success by giving you the opportunity to learn time management, job responsibility, leadership skills, team work, and life skills. Also, earning your own paycheck puts money in your pockets, and what you do with your earnings should be up to you. 2. Track your expenses. Allowances, gifts, and paychecks will be your sources of income as a teenager. Learning to manage money starts with tracking how you spend that income. Create a money diary where you write down all your spending for a given time period, either weekly or monthly. Then, evaluate what you spend by deciding what is needed (such as gas, car insurance, phone bill) and what is entertainment (such as movie tickets, personal items, going out). Creating this diary will help you visualize where your money goes and can set you on the track to create a budget and savings. 3. Save money. Once you earn money, it is very tempting to use it.	In order to be more successful, learn that money can be saved for more-important spending opportunities. To help you save, open up an account. Banks give opportunities to teenagers. Get advice and research before opening any accounts. Once you have one, figure out a monthly budget that helps you put aside money.

Make an attempt to step out of your comfort zone. Switching to a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet can be a major change, and sticking to it can feel difficult if you only focus on what you can’t have. However, your diet can also be a way of opening up new and exciting possibilities. Trying new things helps ensure that you are eating a varied diet and getting all of the nutrients you need. 2. Try ethnic cuisine. Some ethnic cuisines are rich in options for lacto-ovo vegetarians. Dining out at ethnic restaurants can be a great way to try new foods and get ideas for dishes. * Asian cuisines (including Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese) often have meatless options, based on vegetables and/or tofu. Some of these dishes are prepared using fish sauces, so ask if you are unsure. * South Asian cuisines (Indian, Pakistani, Nepali, etc.) often offer meatless dishes based on lentils, rice, curried vegetables, yogurts, and other foods that are permissible in a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet. * It is not too difficult to find meatless options in Mediterranean cuisines (Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern). Look for dishes incorporating falafel, couscous, eggplant, tabbouleh, feta, and other foods. Many specific dishes and sauces are explicitly meatless, such as pasta primavera, marinara and pesto. * Options for lacto-ovo vegetarians in Mexican cuisine include bean-based burritos, vegetable fajitas and nachos, cheese or bean enchiladas, quesadillas, tamales, rice dishes, huevos rancheros, guacamole, salsas, refried beans, and more. Ask if you want to make sure that any of these dishes are not made with lard or other animal products. 3. Look for substitutions. If you have a recipe or dish that traditionally requires meat, there are ways to substitute it with lacto-ovo vegetarian approved options. For example: *	.

First, think about it. Are you on good terms, bad terms, or any terms with this person? What was said the last time you two talked? Was it positive, negative, heated, dry? This may make you decide against contacting this person. Think of questions like " Will making this call harm or help me or the other person?" If you get emotional or negative thoughts, you may want to think twice about contacting them. 2. If after the initial thought process you still feel that you should call this person, think about how you feel they may react. Try and think of all possible scenarios from best to worst. Just think of them, don't make them expections. You want to prepare yourself for anything, yet not get your hopes up and provide yourself with the oppurtunity to be dissapointed. 3. Now you have to pick a contact method. Decide what your favorite medium is, but also take into consideration how they may respond to certain communications. For instance, emails to some seem impersonal or even coward-like, on the flip side you may feel less anxious using written word. Some also may think of sending a text message, I personally wouldnt recommend it.	It also can be read/deleted by another person. Also, can you really say all that needs to be said in 160 characters? You call also take the conventional route via telephone, more personal, tone will be more exact and you may avoid miscommunication, but u may also be ignored and sent to voicemail, but that has to be a risk you are willing to take.

Load up on your vegetables. The green leafy kind &ndash; like spinach, kale, collard greens, chard, and lettuce &ndash; are best. Broccoli, asparagus, turnip greens, lentils, and kidney beans can fulfill your folate requirements to some extent, too. * Beans and pumpkin seeds are good sources of iron as well. Try to mix up your sources so you get a variety of other nutrients, too. Having a wide variety of vegetables, nuts, and beans in your diet will ensure that you're on the right track. 2. Eat more grains and fruits, too. Whole meal bread and dried fruit, like apricots and raisins, are also good for iron. Fenugreek, oatmeal, dates, and fruits such as bananas, apples, and pomegranates are rich in non heme iron and folates, too. * Make sure you have cereals, fruit juices, pastas, and breads fortified with iron, folic acid, and folates. Many products now come fortified with iron, often for this purpose. 3. Take an iron supplement. The pregnant vegan may need to take supplements to help meet the daily requirements of iron in the body. Supplements are usually taken after twenty weeks of pregnancy.	.

Decide what you need your new computer for. If you need one for work, a simple bare bones system with Microsoft Word (or OpenOffice.org) will suffice, but if you're an avid gamer then you'll want a gaming PC. If you want a gaming PC, skip to step 5. 2. If you need a work computer: consult companies like Dell or eBuyer, as they provide low-cost workstation deals for the "common user." On such sites, you can get a computer without a monitor for under $200, and a CRT (cathode ray tube) monitor costs under $50 (the fat ones that stick out at the back). 3. Check The Specifications. You should look at the specs of a computer to see if it's for you. These are Recommended Specifications for your class of PC. * Average "Home User" - 1-2 GHZ Processor (Intel or AMD), 1 GB of (DDR2/DDR3) RAM, 40-160 GB Hard Drive, Decent Graphics Card, DVD/CD-ROM Drive (All in One - read/write dvd's and cd's), 3+ USB 2.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Windows XP * Average "Corporate User" (Businesses) - 2 GHZ Processor (Intel), 2 GB or DDR3 RAM, 320+ GB Hard Drive, Integrated Graphics Card, DVD/CD-ROM Drive (All in One - read/write dvd's and cd's), 3+ USB 2.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Windows Vista/7/Server * Average "Media User" (Home/Work Use - Video Editor/Photo Editor/Music/Video/HD Content) - 2.5-3 GHZ Processor (Intel), 4 GB+ of DDR3 RAM, 500+ GB Hard Drive, Decent Graphics Card, DVD/CD-ROM Drive (All in One - read/write dvd's and cd's), 3+ USB 2.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Windows 7 * Average "Gamer" - 3+ GHZ Processor (Intel or AMD), 4 GB+ of DDR3 RAM, 500+ GB Hard Drive, High End Graphics Card DVD/CD-ROM Drive (All in One - read/write dvd's and cd's), 3+ USB 2.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Windows XP/7 4. Windows Vista takes a large toll on system resources, make sure you have plenty of memory to spare (1 Gigabyte of RAM is required for Home Premium) And try to get a dual or quad core processor, it will make your computer run faster. Linux and Windows XP are much less demanding on your processor and RAM, so if you want to save money it might be better to try to go for a XP or Linux computer to get the same level of speed of a more expensive Vista computer. (XP is not available anymore, but you can install it by yourself.	.
Appreciate_Heavy_Metal.txt	## Steps	If you 're really not into it and seem not to be able to like it , you do n't have to .	## Steps	However , if you 're really not into it and seem not to be able to like it , you do n't have to .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><3>	Steps  1. If you are into Green Day and Good Charlotte, you're at an area where you might have to make some slight changes to the music you like, unless you are already pretty open. I was a Green Day addict my 5th grade year, and I heard Iron Maiden in the beginning of 6th and Black Sabbath became my new favorite band. From here the next step to metal are groups like Megadeth, Judas Priest, Metallica, Slayer, Iron Maiden, and classic Black Sabbath. Remember to take it slow and easy, and really learn to appreciate and like the group. 2. If you are into very flexible styles of music, try listening to progressive heavy metal that doesn't exclusively use the death growl as vocals. Bands like Opeth can show you that both the soft and the brutal can be beautiful. 3. If you are into Beethoven and Mozart, you are in the most flexible state, so it should be easy. If you like these guys, then you should appreciate almost anything as long as it is well done. To get into the style, we would suggest old Metallica, Slayer, and old Anthrax. For getting into or used to the vocals, we would suggest Kreator, Death, and Venom. Stick mainly with old death metal or thrash metal for the beginning. 4. If you are into Suffocation and Vile, this is definitely the best place to be in. For you, I would just suggest getting into groups that are harder and use more harsh vocals (growling/screaming). Just embrace the music and listen to it enough to get use to it and you will eventually enjoy it. As far as groups, I would suggest groups like Cannibal Corpse, Arch Enemy, and Entombed. 5. For a lot of you, the hardest part of liking Metal is the vocals, the aggression, the lack of 'catchiness', and the speed. Well, the only cure for that is to listen to music closer to your original genre that is faster. Listen to more aggressive, but not hate filled, bands. You should also try to understand the lyrics and the mindset of the musicians so you can adopt it yourself, and so you can truly get into the music. Real music does not follow a verse chorus bridge verse chorus cycle. Metal uses a narrative style like classical music. The music progresses and evolves, almost as if it was telling a story. Listening to classical music will help the transition because you would get used to the narrative style. 6. Hard Rock really works for getting into metal.	Listen to some hard rock (MANY songs are Hard Rock and you might not know, such as Beat It by MJ) because that genre surely is very useful.
Age_Brass_Hardware.txt	### Using Brass Ager	Do n't leave your hardware in the brass ager for more than 10 minutes .	### Using Brass Ager	However , do n't leave your hardware in the brass ager for more than 10 minutes .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Do><1><do><3>	Using Brass Ager  1. Remove the hardware from where it’s installed and wipe it clean. Use a clean, dry rag to remove any dust or foreign materials from the hardware. If your hardware is new or uninstalled, you might be able to skip this step. * Whether you need to clean your hardware and how you should go about it will ultimately depend on how dirty it is. Use soapy water and a washcloth if your hardware is particularly dirty. If it’s only a little dusty, just using a dry rag should suffice. * Be careful not to use an abrasive scrubbing cloth, as this might damage the brass. 2. Disassemble the hardware so you're only working with the brass pieces. During the aging process, you’ll only want to be working with hardware made of brass. Make sure whatever brass you’re working with is not attached to hardware made of another substance. * For example, if you're aging a brass candle sconce that has a glass hurricane cover, remove and set aside the glass cover. 3. Pour brass ager into a glass container. Pour enough ager into the container so that you can fully submerge your brass hardware in the liquid. You can also use a plastic container to hold the ager. * Brass ager is a type of antiquing solution specifically used for brass. You can typically find brass ager at any department store and some online retailers. * Be sure to wear protective gloves when handling or working with brass ager. 4. Dip the brass hardware in the ager for at least 30 seconds. Use latex or rubber gloves and submerge the hardware completely in the ager. Leave it submerged for at least 30 seconds before removing it. *	.

When you buy a tax lien (also called a tax deed), you aren't buying the property. You're simply buying the right to collect the taxes that are owed.	Most property owners do pay their taxes eventually, so you'll get your money back, plus fees and interest. The interest rate makes buying tax liens an attractive investment, although you typically won't make any more money than you would through more traditional investment strategies.

Buy_a_Memory_Foam_Mattress.txt	## Steps	A high percentage of people love memory foam mattresses , but a few don 't .	## Steps	If A high percentage of people love memory foam mattresses , but a few don 't .	<insert><If><1>	Steps  1. Make sure the memory foam is of high enough density to support your body properly. The best way to know is to check the package for the density of the foam. Cheap foam is normally 2 to 3 lb. density, mid-grade foam is 3 to 4.5 lb. density and good foam is over 4.5 lb. density. Usually, 5.3 lb. to 5.9 lb is considered the ideal density to properly support the human body. The lighter grade foam won't support you and will quit returning to its original shape after only a few months. 2. Look for memory foam that is temperature sensitive. The one thing that makes Memory Foam so unique is temperature sensitivity. When you first lay down on a memory foam mattress, your body weight causes the mattress to "melt away" from that pressure until your weight is spread evenly over the surface of the mattress. However, after you "settle in," your body temperature begins to affect the material, causing it to soften in the places where there is increased temperature. This fine tuning is what accounts for the unmatched comfort of the genuine memory foam mattresses. 3. Read the warranty information carefully. See exactly what will be required of you when you have a warranty issue. Will you be responsible for shipping, packaging, etc.? Most importantly, how long has the manufacturer been in business? A lifetime warranty from a company that's only been in business for a short while is probably worthless. 4. Check for ample testing done with real people. Many times, testing done in laboratories, without humans, isn't a true picture of what happens out in the "field." The human body is unique and it affects materials differently than a mechanical testing device. 5. Ask for a "comfort test" period. You should be able to sleep on a memory foam mattress for a short period, to see if you have any issues.	Know what to expect if you are one of the few. Will you be able to get a refund of all your money? Or is there a re-stocking fee? Will you be required to "exchange only" with that merchant? If so, make sure they carry a wide variety of products so you'll have lots of choices.

Plan your program. Though calculating percentage isn't difficult, it is always a good practice to plan your program before beginning to code. Try finding the answers of the following questions: * Is your program going to handle large numbers? If yes, then try thinking about ways in which your program can handle large range of numbers. One way of doing this is using a float or long variable instead of int. 2. Write the code. To calculate percentage, you will need two parameters: * The total score (or the maximum possible score); and, * The obtained score whose percentage you wish to calculate. * For example: If a student scores 30 marks out of 100 in a test, and you wish to calculate the percentage marks scored by the student, 100 is the total marks (or the maximum possible score). 30 is the obtained score whose percentage you wish to calculate. * The formula to calculate percentage is:Percentage = (Obtained score x 100) / Total Score * To get these parameters from the user, try using the Scanner function in Java. 3. Calculate the percentage. Use the formula given in the previous step to calculate the percentage. Make sure that the variable used for percentage is of type float. If not, the answer may not be correct. * This is because, the float data-type is 32 bit single precision that even considers decimals in mathematical calculations. Thus, using float, the answer for a mathematical calculation like 5 / 2 will be 2.5 *	.

Wear the hijab if you are truly devoted to turning over a new leaf and becoming the best Muslim girl that you can be. The hijab is not just a piece of cloth that covers hair, it covers and protects your whole self, including your mannerisms, speech, your gaze and your heart. it changes you mentally and spiritually. Think of it as a way for Allah azza wajjal to protect the women. As soon as you wear the hijab, hopefully, your whole perspective on self-respect and values will automatically change. In fact, women are not allowed to pray without the hijab since the hadith of the prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasalam reads "the prayer of a woman will not be accepted without the headcover". Hijab is mandatory, as explained in the Quran 33:59-60 women should cover to be recognized as part of the Muslim group, while in 24:30-31 women are told to pull down their head covers and make them long enough to cover their breasts with a "khumur" which means "something which covers the head". The word is from the same root word for alcohol, since it is a substance when consumed covers and clouds the head and the mind.center|550px 2. Dress modestly. This means that you have to cover your whole body. You have to wear lose cloths, and hijab is not supposed to be fashionable.	Stay away from clothes that are too tight. Remember that it is obligatory to cover the whole body except the face and hands, which are recommended but not obligatory, although some scholars held the view that it is obligatory especially in the hanbali school of thought. if you truly believe according to the evidence it is obligatory, then go ahead and make an effort to cover your face with the niqaab and your hands with gloves as no harm can come from it. This also helps you to change your whole outlook on what is acceptable and what is not.center|550px

Intro	thus We are happy because we have God in our heart , mind and in our family .	<insert><thus><1>	We live under one sky. We look at the same moon. We share facebook account...yet we are far apart. People ask whether we can be happy. I am a teacher while he is a salesman. I'm here and he's there. I don't know how many miles Philippines is away from UAE. One thing's for sure, we see each other only 30 days each year. You see, we went through really tough times. I mean the money, insecurities, jealousy, and paranoia—as in NEGATIVES. We didn’t have quality time, together. We have to live by our demands and bear with them daily, after all. Since nothing lasts and we have GOD who is GOOD all the time…here we are, HAPPY. And this is something I want the world to know.	God makes all of these joys real. God eliminates all sorrows and fears. He makes all things possible in our life…only because HE IS GOD. Back then, as I recall, my husband and I were strangers (of course). But God made a way for us to meet. He arranged “Singles For Christ” for both of us. Eventually, we became friends. (Let’s skip those details my husband and I keep secret with friends and GOD.) Then, we fell in love and got married. God again arranged for us “Couples For Christ”. From then, we have grown in faith and in love. I, along with Irvin—my husband, realized the truth about FALLING in LOVE with GOD. Being in love with Him is being close to HIM through prayers. Being close to Him is like living each day for GOD regardless of shortcomings and imperfections. It’s saying your diary in prayer, after all God is the BEST CONFIDANTE. He never spills your secrets. If things get tough… He counsels. If we feel unsafe, He sends us special people to let His protecting love be felt. If we are bothered, He gives us peace of mind through Bible passages, sensible advice from friends and the soothing power of nature. If we get sick, doctors are easy to reach. See, His love is expressed through His creations. He has given us peace of mind and heart and other privileges no man can ever give. (You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you! IS26:3)Today, my husband and I are happy with Mia and God. People ask us how many we are in the family, we say four: God, Irvin, Myself and Mia. We are so pleased to have Him in our family and He takes the lead. He has taught us virtues and values that make us patient and kind. He has continually taught us to ENDURE. He has sustained us(Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken. Psalm 55:22.). ----- Our family is not perfect but WITH God, we will be all right. I guess, you know now what makes me happy in spite the fact that the world has become “dirty and unfaithful”---it’s GOD all along.

However, if you are skinny, you'll want to avoid the monochromatic look and choose lighter colors and fitted shirts. If you're short, consider accessories like a necklace or watch and avoid wearing big prints or graphic t-shirts. Short rise pants may also help you look taller. * Button down shirts, clean slacks, jeans, and clean t-shirts are all good options for a casual dining date. * Dress up and wear a button down shirt and nice pants if you are on a formal or fancy date. * Don't change your entire look for a date but make sure that you wear fashionable, fitted clothes so that your date is attracted to you. 2. Wash and iron your clothes. Once you pick out an outfit that you'd like to wear, it's important that you clothes are washed and pressed. It will show your date that you put in the effort to look nice, and may impress them. Wrinkled or stained clothes give off a vibe that you couldn't care less about the date, and that it's not really important to you. 3. Smell good. Psychologically, your scent has a big impact on whether your date will find you attractive. Remember to shower or bathe before your date so that you smell fresh. Wear underarm deodorant if you are prone to sweating, and consider wearing a cologne or a fragrance if you typically have body odor. 4. Make a plan. Decide on what you will do on the date in advance.	If you're going to see a show or movie, you can purchase tickets in advance just in case they sell out. Planning in advance will show initiative and will put your date at ease.

They can be used as an additional layer over the lipstick for additional shine. * Lip balms are usually transparent, and are designed to protect the lips from sun and wind, and often to soothe chapped lips and cold sores. * Today you can also find lip stains which change the color of your lips but not the look like lipstick or lipg loss would. * Some categories may overlap: You can find lipsticks with SPF protection, lip gloss that is very thick, for instance. 2. Sample lip cosmetics at the Store. Sometimes samples are available to comparison-shop. You put these on your hand, never on your own lips. 3. Choose a lip stick color. Find the perfect shade for you by experimenting with different colours. * Start with a subtle color, something a few shades darker than your lip color. * Avoid 'bright red at first; a newbie mistake is going straight for the loudest red you can find to announce: "I'm wearing lipstick!". Even if you do look great in that color, any mistake, imperfection, or smudge will stand out. * If you have a sister who is experienced with lip stick color, find out her favorite shades. Sisters tend to look good in similar colors. (But don't share her makeup!) 4. Decide whether you are going to wear lipliner. Today's lipsticks are better formulated than those of the past. For a beginner, it's usually an unnecessary step. If you do, it should be neutral or match the colour of your lipstick. 5. Apply your lipstick first. Stretch the lips and start at the center, putting on the lipstick to the corners. Blot the lipstick with a tissue. Make sure the lipstick has not smudged over the line of your lips. 6.	Stretch your lips and draw the stain in a line in the center of each lip, upper and lower. Rub your lips together and blot.

Lovely makeup , cute hair and nice clothes mean nothing if you do n't think you look good !	<insert><And><1>|||<replace><Lastly><1><lastly><2>	Steps  1. Start purchasing dresses Hime gyaru is about a sweet and innocent princess appearance. If you already have cute, frilly dresses, that's a good starting point. Dresses are mostly knee-length, but some are shorter. Popular things on hime gyaru dresses are fake fur, pearls, animal print, flowers, bows and anything that's cute and sweet. But keep all these things in moderation, like ruffles just at the bottom of a dress, or lace on the sleeves. Don't make yourself look like your outfit it's eating you alive! Dressed tend to be very regal looking, and generally are in pastel colors-- after all, you're a princesss girl! Some popular brands are Jesus Diamante and Liz Lisa. 2. You don't always have to wear dresses! If you have a nice pair of jeans with no holes, pair it with tops that have bows, lace, animal print, and anything very cute and hime. Add some matching ballet flats or heels and a pearl necklace/cute jewelry, along with cute gyaru makeup and hair. Just be sure to keep it very nice--princess gal, remember? 3. Makeup is important! Himegyaru gals usually wear lots of makeup, but it is very simple looking. Usually a himegyaru will wear liquid (most popular) eyeliner in black, light foundation, false eyelashes and/or mascara and pink lipgloss/lipstick. Eye makeup is usually done to make the eyes appear larger. Tanning is optional, but if you do get one, don't make it very dark or orange, usually Hime gals just use a light bronzer if they choose to tan at all. 4. Get a hair accessory. One huge flower (i.e. a rose) or a silk bow are good hair accessories. If you don't have a bow a little crown or tiara (it shouldn't be too big or it will look funny), whether plastic or metal, will be an adorable option. You MUST have a hair accessory. Popular hairstyles include having your hair teased into a high beehive or boufant hairstyle, with lots of curls, or having a nice, simple bun. Straightened hair isn't very hime unless you have a boufant to accompany it--the elaborate big-hair hairdo is a trademark himegyaru style. The hime haircut is perfect for himegyaru--it's basically long bangs cut to your jaw, with regular bangs as well, the rest of the hair is cut evenly at one length. 5. Get some type of nails. Fake nails are very pretty, especially they are nice if you naturally have short nails, but if you want to go totally natural, a clear or shimmery white nail coating can be used. They should be decorated/painted in some fashion. Many tutorials for himegyaru nails are available online. 6. Hime Gals aren't usually snobby! Be kind to others, and don't dumb yourself down to seem like a perfect princess!! And you don't always have to be frilly and girly, you can still do anything you want, gyaru is simply a fashion, it doesn't restrict what music you listen to, activites you do in your spare time, or how you choose to act.	.

Tap your networks for positions. Even though jewelers are increasingly gaining positions after a formal education, there is a long-established history of jewelers learning their craft through long-term on-the-job experience. Many family-owned local jewelry stores are still in operation, and family members learn key skills of the trade from their parents or relatives. If you do not wish to enter a formal program, talk to your family members, friends, and acquaintances who are in the industry about opportunities in your area. They will be able to guide you to potential openings where you could learn key skills on-the-job. *	It is possible that the only job opportunities given to you will seem unrelated to jewelry making.

Memorize several monologues. Always have two to five monologues ready to perform. You never know when a call is going to come up, and it’s best to be prepared rather than cramming at the last minute.center * Make sure that the monologues are distinct. If one is dramatic, the other should be comedic. Likewise, it’s good to have one modern work and one classic or Shakespearean monologue. * You'll stand out more if you choose unique monologues. Look through books and films for monologues that will allow you to showcase your special talent; chances are, they won't be the same ones the casting director has seen a hundred times before. 2. Get headshots. You need them to get an agent, as well as to audition at open casting calls.center * Work with a professional photographer who specializes in acting and performance headshots, and make sure that he or she will provide make-up and hair styling. * Know your type. Roles are written for certain looks and types, and you should have photos that meet these casting criteria. If your look and acting-age is “high school cheerleader,” include that look in your photo package. Likewise, if you’d make a great vampire, suburban mom or mob-wife, have photos taken that capture that aspect of your look and acting-age. *	Some agencies may ask you to email your resume and headshots.

To decrease the spray pattern, move the threaded collar to the right. * Adjust the spray pattern while the sprinkler is on so you can determine how much of an increase or decrease you want. 2. Find the arc adjustable tab on the head. If you have the Rain Bird 2SA, 42SA, 42SA+, 52SA Series, they will have an adjustable tab for the spray pattern on the top of the head. The tab will have a plus and minus symbol. * There will also be a screw in the center of the plus and minus symbol. 3. Use a screwdriver to adjust the pattern. Place a flat-headed screwdriver on the screw on the top of the head.	Twist the screw towards the minus symbol, or counterclockwise, to decrease the spray pattern.

Bring your Syrian hamster home as quickly as possible. Then after about 48 hours (2 days), slowly start to get to know how your hamster likes to be handled. Before the taming process, it is a good idea to leave them alone for one or two days. You should never start by picking your hamster up! Try holding our treats for them. If they are too shy to take if from your hands, don't chase them, just put the treat down and wait for them to take it. Do this several times a day until your pet is comfortable with you. Then try putting the treat in your hand. After they will climb happily into your hand, try petting them gently as they eat. The last step is gently cupping them in your hands. This may take a long time with aggressive females, but tame, friendly males will allow you to hold them after just a few days. The ideal time to wait before picking up your hamster and taking it out of the cage to play is two to three weeks. To hold your hamster, slide one hand under it and cup the other round the front of its body. Ensure you are gentle.center 2. Keep the cage clean. Syrian hamster cages should be cleaned out every other week or so and "spot cleaned" (removing fresh foods, cleaning toilet areas etc) each day, depending on the size and type of cage. Make sure its cage has been correctly disinfected and bedding has been changed before putting your hamster back in. While you clean the cage, you can put your pet in a hamster ball and have someone supervise it - but the hamster ball must be the right size -- most balls are only 6" wide, so most are too small for Syrian hamsters. Get a larger 10" ball at a minimum. Or, put the hamster in a pen, supervised, so it cannot escape. Cleaning the cage too often can cause stress; this does not mean do not clean your cage, rather, just clean it every other week and remember spot cleaning is your best friend.center * To clean the cage, take the top off and empty all the dirty bedding and wood shavings and old food into a dustbin. Scrape out all the other remains. Go over the cage with a pet-made disinfectant, then dry it with tissues or kitchen roll, if preferred.	Dust and rinse all items of the cage. Dry everything and fill the cage with fresh wood shavings, bedding, food, and water. Put all the items back in the cage and clip the top back on. Remember to hose out the cage once every month. A clean cage makes your Syrian hamster happy and healthy.

The value of assets such as a house or car can go up and down over time, so when calculating the value of an estate you need to give a specific date that you are using. Items are valued according to a fair market value, which may be higher or lower than the price originally paid. If you are calculating the value of a living person’s estate, you may choose any date of calculation you wish. 2. Choose a date of calculation for a decedent’s estate. If the estate you are valuing is that of somebody who has died, a decedent, you may choose to use the date of death, or the date six months after the date of death, as the date of calculation. The date six months after the date of death is referred to as the "alternate valuation date." If the date of death is selected, all assets are valued as of the date of death, regardless of dates of distribution or sale. * If the “alternate valuation date” is selected, and any asset is sold or distributed during the first six months following the date of death, the estate's assets are valued in one of two ways. * Either, all assets not sold or distributed during the six months after the date of death are valued as of the alternate date. *	.

Consider the best case scenario. If you cannot stop worrying about how something could go wrong, flip the script and focus, instead, on the most positive possible outcome in that situation. Instead of trying to ignore the thing that is causing you stress entirely, you are letting your mind think about the thing that’s preoccupying it, but guiding your thoughts toward a direction that causes you less stress and anxiety. 2. Create positive constructions out of negative ones. If someone tells you not to slam the door, the first thing your mind does is imagine a door slamming, then remind itself not to do that. When you frame something with a negative grammatical construction — “don’t think about X” — your brain has to think about that thing in order to remind itself not to. That doesn’t make any sense! Instead, create positive grammatical constructions. * For example, if you’re worried about a job interview, don’t think “don’t forget my portfolio.” Think “remember your portfolio.” Instead of “don’t blow it,” think “I’m going to nail it.” 3. Postpone the bad thought. Since some research shows that the most effective way to deal with an unwanted thought is to simply let it run its course, you might have to confront the thought at some point.	If a bad thought comes into your mind when you don’t have time to deal with it, don’t panic. Calmly promise yourself that you’ll deal with the thought when you have more time, later in the day.

Identify the thoughts you want to change. In order to change your thinking you need to know the exact thoughts and thought patterns that are troubling you or causing emotional distress. * Some examples of negative thoughts are, “I am stupid. I can’t do anything right. I know I am going to fail. I know that person hates me. I hate that person.” * There are also specific types of thinking habits or patterns like catastrophizing, which means you often think the worst case scenario will occur. Other thinking patterns include: over-generalizing (thinking in always or never, such as, “I always mess things up.”), mind-reading (thinking you know what someone else is thinking such as, “I know he hates me”.), and predicting the future (thinking you know what will happen such as, “I am going to lose”). * Make a list of the thoughts and thought patterns you want to change so that you can refer to them later. * Write down which patterns or habits you tend to have. * Be aware that some thoughts that may be considered "bad" are simply part of human nature, e.g. sexual thoughts, or "what if" scenarios that stem from our desire for personal safety. These thoughts are okay to have, and normal, and come from good instincts (like to procreate or protect ourselves and loved ones). * If these thoughts become intrusive or interfere with your daily life, then you may need to address the obsessive nature of the thoughts. But remember, that still doesn't make the thoughts themselves bad. 2. Change your bad thoughts. After you have identified your bad thoughts and thinking patterns, you can begin in develop alternative thoughts. * Notice when you have a negative thought. Identify the thought and then change it to something more realistic and appropriate. For example, if your thought it, “I never do anything right,” change this thought to something more accurate such as, “Sometimes I make mistakes and that’s okay. I am human. I will do better next time.” * Catch yourself when you think a bad thought and say to yourself, “Wait a second! That is not a good thought and it’s not true. I know I can turn this thinking around to something positive.” * A therapist who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can also help you with this process and give you additional techniques to try. 3. Create positive constructions out of negative ones.	When you frame something with a negative grammatical construction — “don’t think about X” — your brain has to think about that thing in order to remind itself not to. That doesn’t make any sense!

Decide whether you are going to join a roleplay or make one. If you're going to make one, be sure to decorate your den for it before advertising it! If you're going to join a roleplay, will it be a random roleplay or will you ask your friends to help make one? Or will you just join the public roleplay that is usually going on in Sarepia Forest in the more crowded serves (such as Draa and Aldan)? Make sure to avoid roleplayers who say "nm, nn," etc. This means "No miss" or "No nothing" which means they are trying to make it so that you take their attacks no matter what. This is called powerplaying and it is not good roleplaying! Just block or ignore anyone who does this to you.Do not go overboard with the violence, either; if your roleplay has any blood in it. Animal Jam is a kids' game; most can handle something like a Jammer getting bitten, but don't overdo it. Aldan (crowded server) has the most powerplayers most of the time, but not all roleplayers on Aldan are like this. 2. Decide the rules of your roleplay. Does everyone have to be a traditional unicorn? Is it accepting of all types of unicorns? Do you all have to be llamas and deer, or can anyone join? Is blood allowed even in minor amounts? Does the roleplay take place in Jamaa, or a made up dimension? Can Jamaa's lore (Mira, Zios, Shamans, etc.) affect the roleplay? Are only Buddies allowed in the roleplay, or is your den unlocked? 3.	Is your unicorn the leader or another rank? Does your herd have ranks? If your herd is going to be made up of other Jammers, advertise your unicorn roleplay in Jamaa Township (usually the most crowded place in Jamaa) in a crowded server (like Draa or Grande).

Shower 1 hour before, no perfume, no "statements" like punk clothing/haircuts/jewelry/nose or earrings/other body art. If you want to sell yourself, be relaxed and ready to kick butt. * Do a bit of research in advance of the interview and learn about the company's history and direction. During the interview, refer to things you've learned about the company. This tells the interviewer that you have an interest in the company and understand its mission, giving you an edge over applicants who simply "walk in". * Keep in mind that a job interview is not "just about you". It is also your opportunity to determine if the company is one you wish to work for. When the interviewer asks if you have any questions, the worst thing you can do is say no. Always have at least two or three job or company related questions ready. * Give yourself plenty of time to get to the interview. You don't want to be late or rushed--arriving early will allow you to enter the interview calm, cool and collected (and ready to answer questions). * Check the weather forecast. Inclement weather can delay travel time. If rain is predicted, bring an umbrella. You don't want to arrive looking like a drowned rat. * Turn potentially negative answers into positive ones. A common example would be "What are your weaknesses?" The worst answer to give is that you haven't any.	"I learned in my previous position that my computer skills were not as strong as I would have preferred. I have since completed classroom training in that area, and have greatly improved." Remember, the question isn't meant to determine what the "weaknesses" are- it is meant to determine what you have done to correct them.

The height should be three to eight feet, depending upon the breed, size, and temperament of the dog. 2. Add additional security where needed. In mountain lion and bear country, the dog run should have a secure top. In areas where venomous snakes may be present, a bottom course of wire cloth may be added. 3. Create the fence. Ideal construction would be chain link fencing with steel posts, over a concrete pad. 4. Excavate the pad to a depth of six inches. 5.

Hair. Do not feel that your hair must always be perfect. Even if it seems old fashioned, the best way to make your hair look pretty and natural (besides shampoo/conditioner) is to brush it regularly. Most kids will never bother curling or straightening their hair so you shouldn't either. If you want to, you may wear a few hair accessories (like hairclips, bows, ribbons etc) but keep it simple. Or, tie it up in a ponytail, pigtails or braids, but leave it at that.  2. Clothes. Dress classy. Pastel pinks, Purples, greens, light blues etc, are good. If you want to be extra feminine, go with floral prints. You may also wear hooded jackets, blouses, dungarees (overalls) and little print dresses or skirts with cute designs. You are a child, it is acceptable to wear whatever you like. However, avoid wearing black, anything with inappropriate slogans, or garments that expose cleavage or underwear.	That is not very childlike. And also, steer clear of any clothing with logos splashed all over them.

Understanding your own strengths and weaknesses. There are numerous personality traits which an entrepreneur may exhibit, these include: confidence, passion, resilience and vision to take advantage of opportunities and being responsible for the risks which may be associated with this (e.g. new opportunities within the workplace such being responsible for a budget). However, this is not an exhaustive list with entrepreneurs also exhibiting various other traits which sadly goes beyond the scope of this article including a strong sales ability and tenacity. Nevertheless, there is one key trait which arguably may distinguish between entrepreneurs who are successful and ones who sadly meet their demise. Doubtless, the former is what this article wishes to encourage as to the latter. This is because retrospective analysis of failure is seldom a comfortable prospect, but is ever so present in today's competitive landscape. The key trait is 'self awareness' - having the ability to take an objective view about your own strengths and weakness could be key in being able to develop into a successful entrepreneur within the workplace. This is because being able to recognise your weaknesses could allow you to develop those areas in order to strengthen your skill set. Prima facia, this may seem simple but can be difficult for many to take an honest self reflection of their own ability. In doing this effectively, you are ready for step two. 2. Taking on the opportunities which come your way. Within the workplace you may be faced with a number of challenges and opportunities which could allow you to effectively use your strengths to establish positive results. Through successfully completing step one you are now in a strong position to be able to assess whether you are able to effectively take on the opportunities/challenges and the risks associated with this (i.e. job security, reputation) which the workplace may throw at you, and also whether you may require additional training or support from other members of staff to counter your weaknesses in order to fully take advantage of the opportunities and challenges you wish to face (i.e. meeting a target). This reflects the notion of 'calculated risk taking' and 'self awareness' which both are characteristics of an entrepreneur. 3. Be adaptable. In taking on the challenges within the workplace this shows you can be adaptable. Use your position within an organisation as an opportunity to be able to gain new skills and test your knowledge. Through following through steps one and two you can then look to develop new capabilities and turn those weaknesses into strengths. Look to take time in observing others within the workplace and ask questions. This will allow you to develop new capabilities and turn those weaknesses identified in step one into strengths.	.
Band_a_Mane.txt	## Steps	If your horse 's forelock is sparse or very unruly , you can feel free to band it .	## Section::::Steps.	However , if your horse 's forelock is sparse or very unruly , you can feel free to band it .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><3>	Steps  1. Trim and pull your horses mane over several weeks prior to the show. Depending on what level you are showing at, you can keep the mane shorter (2-3 inches) or longer. If you are planning on showing at a breed-level show or better (Congress, World, etc.), you will need your mane as short as is attractive. If you are showing 4-H or open shows and you keep your horse out in a pasture, a longer mane (4-6 inches) is often acceptable. To pull the mane, trim the mane with scissors or a razor blade about 1-2 inches longer than where you want it to end up after pulling. Then take a small comb and seperate an inch or two of mane and hold it in your hand. Slide your fingers down the hairs until you are holding the longest hairs in the bunch. Take your comb and brush the rest of the hairs up toward the crest, still holding the longest hairs in the other hand. Either using your comb or a couple fingers, wind the long hairs around the comb or fingers until you have a good hold on them and tug the hairs firmly away from the crest. Make certain not to pull more than 5-10 or so hairs at a time, as it can be painful for the horse. Continue doing small sections like this until you have an evenly pulled mane. 2. Once the mane is pulled, you can get ready to band! You will need bands of the same color as your horse's mane, water (preferably in a spray bottle), a banding comb, a hair clip or two, and some sort of product to get the mane sticky. Quick Braid is a great product, but cheap hair gel will work in a pinch. You may also need a step stool depending on the height of your horse. Before you get started, organize your tools so everything is in reach. A grooming apron, overalls with lots of pockets, or an inexpensive tool belt will do. If you don't have a spray bottle for your water, make sure your bucket of water and sponge are close by. 3. First, wet the horse's mane until it is damp, but not so wet that it becomes too slippery to handle. Next, apply your Quick Braid or gel until the hair feels workable, but not too sticky. Comb the product through the mane so it is applied evenly. 4. Next, prepare to band. The trick to a good banding job is quality AND quantity of the bands. You want small, well-defined bands that number as many as 40-60 bands for the length of the mane. If you are going to a smaller show, you can easily bring that amount down towards 25-30 if you choose. 5. Starting at the end of the bridlepath, part out your first section of mane. Using your banding comb, for a pro mane, use only a section as large as a single section of the comb. For a quicker mane, use two sections. Use your hair clip to hold the remaining hair out of your way. Take your section of hair and braid it about a half inch. This brings the outside hairs into the band and makes neater bands with better parts in between them. Then take a single band and wrap it neatly about the braided section 3-4 times or until the band is snug. The band should be level with the edge of the horse's crest that is closest to you so that the bands will echo the shape of the crest as you work along the mane. To secure the band and lay the hairs flat, reach under the band and take a small section of hairs and part it in two. Using both hands, take one piece in each and pull the pieces gently - slightly downward and to each side. It should look like you are making an upsidedown "V" under the band. Pull gently on these pieces upward along the neck, toward the crest, until the band pulls snug against the horse's neck. 6. Continue this pattern down the mane until you reach the thin hair around the withers. You may need to rewet the mane regularly as you work. If you are showing in halter or showmanship, make sure to run your bands as far down as you can without making them look sparse or unkempt. Lightly gel or hairspray the remaining mane so that it lays flat on the withers on the same side as the mane. If you are showing in riding events only, try your saddle and pad on your horse and end the bands where the pad lays on the withers. The rest you can leave alone since it will be covered by the pad in your classes. 7. If you choose, you can band your horse's forelock as well. If your horse has a forelock that is full and well-kept, feel free to leave it out and just lightly gel the top of it so it lays down the center of the horse's head.	Wet it down as you did the mane and apply product. use the banding comb to help you seperate the forelock into three sections. Braid the forelock down about an inch and then band it up right where the hair from the bottom of the forelock grows. Tighten down the band just as you did the mane.
Attend_to_a_Stab_Wound.txt	## Steps	To slow bleeding in the arm , press the inside of the arm just above the elbow or just below the armpit .	### Attending to the Stab Wound	For example , to slow bleeding in the arm , press the inside of the arm just above the elbow or just below the armpit .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><To><1><to><4>	Steps  1. Assess the situation as a whole before involving yourself. A stabbing often occurs within a volatile event and the attacker or provokers may still be in the vicinity, threatening others. Avoid making yourself another potential victim by going near such people until it's clear that they've left the scene. While this loses precious time for the person stabbed, having more people stabbed is hardly conducive to rescuing anybody. * Call for emergency help immediately. 2. If possible, put on disposable gloves. This is vital in reducing the risk of infection to yourself or the victim. If available, nitrile or other non-latex gloves are preferable as they minimize the possibility of an allergic reaction to latex which may complicate treatment. They are most commonly blue or purple and are rapidly replacing the white latex gloves that were previously the standard. Alternatives include plastic bags over your hands, or having clean hands if there is no other choice than to touch bare-handed. * Remember, you do not have to touch the person if you believe that you are in danger of contracting a pathogen they may be infected with or are otherwise uncomfortable. Wait for emergency assistance if you are in doubt, your safety must come before that of the patient. If you choose to treat them, do your best to minimize contact with the victim's blood. 3. Check the victim's airway before all else. If there is blood present, this will be an obstruction to their breathing and needs to be cleared out. It is more likely to be an issue if the stab wound is close to the chest. 4. Remove the victim's clothing with care. This will enable you identify the precise location of the stab wound. It can be obscured by both clothing and by blood or other fluids and even dirt or mud, depending on where the victim is found. 5. Leave the stabbing object in the wound if it is still there. Pulling it out will increase blood loss, and pushing it in may cause further injury. You'll just need to dress the wound around the knife the best that you can. 6. Stop the bleeding through use of a dressing. Apply pressure on the wound with a clean and absorbent material (like a shirt or towel), or preferably, a clean dressing. If the object is still in the wound, press firmly around it. Applying pressure to the wound will help to slow down the rate of bleeding. * Some first aid training suggests using the edge of a credit card to "seal" the wound, an item that's handy because so many people have one on them. Not only does this stem blood flow, but it may also prevent lung collapse (by keeping air out of the wound) if the wound is in the chest. 7. If the wound is bleeding profusely, apply pressure to the major artery leading to the area with the pads of your fingers, pushing down to the bone, while your other hand continues to apply pressure on the wound.	If the wound is on the leg, press just behind the knee or in the groin. If bleeding persists, apply a tourniquet.

Wash away any grit and hair. Use your shower to wash away any debris in the way. If you have a removable shower head, use it to spray around the tub. Otherwise, use a cup or small bucket to pour water around. 2. Try a grapefruit and salt scrub. The acid from the grapefruit combined with the abrasiveness of the salt helps to scrub away grime. Plus, the grapefruit leaves your bathroom smelling like citrus. * Cut a grapefruit in half. Cover the open half with salt. * Sprinkle salt on the wet tub. * Scrub the tub with the grapefruit, releasing juice as you go. You may need to switch to another half to scrub away all the grime in your bathtub. You may even need more than one grapefruit. * Rinse away any salt and pulp. 3. Create a bathtub and sink scrub. You may already have the ingredients in your home, especially if you like organic soaps. * Mix 1 cup of baking soda with 1/2 cup of Castile soap and a few drops of peppermint or tea tree essential oil. * Use the mixture on a sponge to scrub down your tub. It works especially well on soap scum. Rinse it away when your tub is clean. 4. Make a vinegar spray. Vinegar is slightly acidic, so it can help remove bacteria and stains. * In a clean spray bottle, add 1 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of water. Shake vigorously. * Spray it on your tub. Use a sponge to scrub it down. Rinse away the vinegar. 5. Use baking soda paste. This paste works well for rust stains, but you can also use it as a general cleaner. * Add water to baking soda until it forms a paste-like substance. * Use a sponge to apply the paste to rust stains. Scrub to remove the stain.	.

Choose_a_Pet.txt	## Steps	Birds should be misted every few days .	### Learning About Different Pets	And birds should be misted every few days .	<insert><And><1>|||<replace><Birds><1><birds><2>	Steps  1. Adopting the right pet can be a challenge. Think about what type of animals you like. Do you like small and easy-to-care for pets? Or do you like medium care pets? Or do you like large animals? When your thinking about size remember how cats and dogs can grow, big cats can stay a good size but some cats grow big. It all depends on the type of cat or dog. 2. The cost of a pet can play a factor in choosing the right pet. Consider both the initial cost to purchase the animal as well as on-going maintenance cost of feeding, veterinary care, etc. 3. If you're thinking of getting exotic pets, check your municipal/county, provincial/state and federal laws on owning and importing the animal. If you're importing an animal from outside the country, check with the airlines and/or Customs/Port Authority on the necessary paperwork and quarantine procedures for animals coming from the source country. These regulations can change between borders without notice at any given time depending on health regulations. 4. Look at what your housing allows. If you're renting or living in an apartment or condo, does your building allow the type of pet that you want? Rules can vary widely. Many buildings allow smaller pets but not larger ones, some won't allow certain animals regardless of size, some allow pets with a larger damage deposit, etc. Check with your landlord for the specific species, breed and size you're thinking of getting. Get permission in writing, have your lease/contract updated if you think there could be a problem. 5. Ask yourself various questions about different kinds of pets: * Aquatic Pets * How much space do you have to spare? Do you have a plug near your free space? (for an aquarium). * Do you have enough time to look after it? This means more than feeding. Do you have the time to commit to regular aquarium cleaning sessions: bagging the fish individually, cleaning out pumps and filters, washing the entire structure and then gently putting the fish back without upsetting them too much? * Avian Pets * Do you have enough space? The larger the bird the larger the cage it needs. * Some birds, especially large parrots, have long life spans. African Grey parrots, for example, live an average of 50 years. Budgies, on the other hand, live 5-15 years. Don't choose a bird that you're not willing to make a lifetime commitment to. * Do you have time to spend with them? Cages need to be cleaned weekly.	They need at least several hours a day of interaction with a human. A lone bird can get bored easily and can develop bad habits of over-grooming and over-eating which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Toys and appropriate avian companions can help mitigate this issue, but they still require interaction with the family, they may not get along with their bird companions and it would also affect overall costs, space, etc.

I do not usually use cell styles which I do recognize have some advantages over simply copying format from cell to cell. I found one really good use of cell styles however that I want to share. When using the format painter or paste/paste special, there are 6 aspects of formatting that are applied, and you cannot be more selective than excluding or including formatting (all 6 aspects) when you paste. If you use the Format Cells dialog to apply a format, you see the 6 aspects indicated in different tabs.	This allows the user to get around some sticky situations that the format painter and paste will mess up. Sometimes there are both similarities and differences in some existing format and a desired format in another cell. One example is where alignment format, particularly merged cells is different, yet font format is the same. Suppose that a cell has a particular font format set different from the default. Another group of cells adjacent to one another have merged cell formatting applied. If you want to copy the formatting from the single cell to the merged cells, the cells will no longer be merged if you paste or use format painter. Fortunately, cell styles offers a different solution that can preserve the alignment format, while overriding the font format.

Manage your response in the days that follow. Your reaction after a child attempts suicide varies. You might be intensely angry. You might be tempted to never let your child out of your sight again. You might feel guilty. You might feel irritated because you think your child is just acting out. Whatever you feel, keep these emotions in check around your child. Regardless if the attempt was a "cry for help" or something more, your child obviously really needs you if the only way he knew how to deal with what he was feeling was to take his own life. * Immediately after, resist the urge to ask "why?" or assign blame. The details will eventually come out in the following days and weeks. The important thing right now is that your child is alive. You need to express love, concern, and appreciation that he or she is still here with you, that you have a second chance. * Use "I" statements and openly tell your child how scared and upset you were. Prompts for talking with your child may include: * I feel terrible that you did not feel you could come to me with a problem. I am here now. * I want you to know that I love you and, no matter what, we will get through this as a family. * I understand you must be hurting. Tell me how I can help you. 2. Attend to your emotional needs. Caring for a child who has committed suicide can be an emotionally draining job. Enlist the help of close friends and relatives to help you and your family as you cope with the aftermath. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Remember, you can't give to anyone if your own cup is empty. Look after yourself, too. * Panicking, punishing, blaming and criticizing will not help your child or your family right now. If you have the urge to do these things, take time away for yourself. Ask a friend or family member to supervise your child and get some alone time. Write down your thoughts. Pray. Meditate. Listen to relaxing music. Go for a walk. If you must, cry your eyes out. 3. Talk to someone for your own well-being. Lean on a supportive friend, family member or co-worker. Do not give in to the pervasive stigma about suicide and mental illness. Talking to someone else about what you and your family are going through can help you gain encouragement and come to terms with your feelings about the situation. Plus, sharing your story might help another person identify suicidal behavior in an adolescent, and maybe save a life. * If you are having difficulty coming to terms with what's happened, if you cannot control your anger or hurt feelings, or if you constantly blame yourself and your parenting skills for your child's suicide attempt, you should see a counselor. Reach out to a support group or one of your child's mental health providers for a referral to a professional who can help you sort through these feelings. 4. Prepare for upsetting information as it comes out. Having someone you can confide in or speaking with a mental health provider will be significant in the coming weeks. You can expect to learn some devastating information about your child and his or her health and well-being. For example, an adolescent who identifies as homosexual is 2 to 3 times more likely to make a lethal attempt. Substance abusers are also at high risk.	.

Abuse can hurt or destroy their self-esteem, so you can be helpful by building them up a little. * Mention the qualities you like most about them (resilience, wisdom, kindness, etc.). * Do activities together (e.g. bowling, painting) that they are good at. Help them feel successful and competent. * Ask them for advice about something. * Help a woman feel pretty by complimenting her looks or dolling her up. 4. Talk about a safety plan. If your loved one recognizes that there is a problem, you can help them come up with a plan if they feel unsafe. Write it down, or if they feel their abuser will find it, keep it verbal. 5. Suggest that they get expert advice. If your loved one asks for advice, this is a good sign. You can help a little, but you may feel overwhelmed and confused by the enormity of the problem. Don't be afraid to suggest that they see someone who is more qualified. *	I feel in over my head. Maybe it would help if you looked to someone more qualified for advice. I could help you find someone, and I promise I'll still be here for you."

Wash your hands. Before you touch your road rash, you need to wash your hands. Run your hands under fresh water in the sink. Add soap to your hands and lather them all over by rubbing them together. Keep rubbing for at least 20 seconds, being careful to clean around your fingernails, in between your fingers, and up to your elbows. Then rinse the soap from your hands and arms with more clean water. * Dry them off on a clean towel. * If you have any road rash on or near your hands, avoid getting it wet until you can clean it out. 2. Stop your rash from bleeding. Before you can properly clean your road rash, you need to stop the wound from bleeding. If it is a very minor road rash, it may stop bleeding on its own. If it is a slightly deeper road rash, you will have to apply pressure to stop the bleeding. Find a sterile bandage or clean cloth. Apply direct pressure to the wound with the cloth. * Elevate the wound as well to help stop the bleeding. * If there are large pieces of debris in the wound, remove those gently before you apply pressure. You don't want to embed them deeper into your wound. * If the road rash takes longer than 10 minutes to stop bleeding, see your doctor as soon as you can. 3.	In order to ensure that your road rash doesn't get dirtier than it is, you need to clean the area around your wound. This will make sure that germs do not get in your road rash from the skin around it. It will also help remove any blood from around the wound as well. To clean around it, use a soapy washcloth to clean the area around your rash. Instead of running your rash under water, rinse out the rag and wipe the soap off the surrounding area.

Name your language. You have full control over it! 2. How should it be pronounced? You can choose how to pronounce the language, but to make it look professional, you might need to learn the Dictionary make sure you have the definitions too. 3. Create the language's alphabet. This is where you can get creative. It could be anything you want. Some ideas include: * Use pictographs or symbols. Many languages, like Chinese, use pictographs or symbols to represent their spoken language. If you choose to do this, you'll also have to come up with a pronunciation for each symbol. Each symbol will have its own unique sound. Numbers are a good example. This is a beautiful but cumbersome route. * Make up an alphabet or syllabary. English, Russian, Greek, Hindi, Japanese... Create a set of symbols which represent individual letters or entire syllables, or even dipthongs. * Use an alphabet already in existence. If you use our English alphabet, for example, you will simply have to create new words for things rather than coming up for an entirely new pronunciation system. * Combine different alphabets. Add accents to existing letters (ex: spanish's ñ) to create new letters or sounds. 4. Create the vocabulary. These are the words for your language. You should start off by making common words first, and then move on to less common words. * Start with the foundation words, the words that will be used very often. These are words like "I", "he", "his", "and", "a", "to", and "the". Then move on to verbs such as "to be", "to have", "to like", "to go", and "to make". Don't forget about a e i o u y that makes a big part in accents. * Move on to common things. As your vocabulary grows, start naming everything you can think of. Remember countries, body parts, action words, etc. Don't forget numbers! * If you're stumped, remember you can borrow words from other languages. You can even alter the word. For example, the french word for man is homme. The Spanish word—hombre—is almost the same, with only a few letters/the pronunciation changed. * Open the dictionary and begin copying words with their translations. Not only will this be helpful if you forget how to say something, but it will ensure you don't miss a word. * Try to make the words easily pronounceable—you don't want to be stuck with tongue twisters every time you open your mouth. * Make your words appear natural. One common pitfall for language makers is to use too many apostrophes in vocabulary words. 5. Create the grammar rules for your language. These describe how sentences are formed. You can copy many from existing languages, but you should change some rules to stay original. 6. If you want to make your language well known then write enough dictionaries of the language including it's alphabet to learn your language and give them out to everyone you want to use the language with. * Decide how to pluralize nouns. You need to have a way to tell the difference between "book" and "books". Many languages add an -s as a suffix. You could choose to add a suffix or even a prefix to your words. You may even add a whole new word! (Examples: If book = Skaru, then books may equal Neskaru, Skarune, Skaneru, Skaru Ne, or Ne Skaru, etc.!)) * Decide how create the tenses of the verbs, which tell when something happened. The three main tenses are past, present, and future. You may also want a way to tell the difference between words like "swim" and "swimming". But it's not necessary. For example	.

In English , adjectives have three levels of strength .	### Identifying Basic Grammar Rules	For example , in English , adjectives have three levels of strength .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><In><1><in><4>	[[Doc:Dothraki Phrases,Klingon Phrases,Na'vi Phrases]]  1. Learn IPA. IPA (or the International Phonetic Alphabet) is a widely used system transcribe sounds into symbols. For example, the "sh" sound in "share" is represented by /ʃ/ in the IPA. This will help you make sure you keep the pronunciation of your language consistent, and also help you to make words.center 2. Start with phonotactics. You need to choose a firm phonetic inventory, or phonology (what sounds are in your language) and phonotactics, a rule which defines how sounds are used in a word. For example, in English, you wouldn't start a word with ng-. These vary from language to language - "ng" can start words in Indonesian. These can give your language a unique sound, so choose wisely. Additionally, if you are making multiple languages, all of which are related, you should choose similar phonologies and phonotactics.center 3. Create the language's script. This is where you can get creative. It could be anything you want. You have some choices:center * Use pictographs or symbols. Many languages, like Chinese, use pictographs or symbols to represent their spoken language. If you choose to do this, you'll also have to come up with a pronunciation for each symbol. Each symbol will have its own unique sound. Numbers are a good example. This is a beautiful but cumbersome route. * Make up an alphabet or a syllabary. An alphabet is a system where a letter represents a sound/phoneme. In a syllabary, each letter represents a syllable. * Use an alphabet already in existence. If you use the Latin alphabet, for example, you will have to assign a pronunciation to each letter (and combination of letters, if you choose). The pronunciations of letters are not too different across languages that use them (for instance, a B is pronounced the same way in English and French), so you can use pronunciations that they already have in existing languages. * Add accents to existing letters (eg.: Spanish's ñ) to create new letters or sounds. For instance, E can be pronounced /ɛ/ (the "e" in "dress"), while É is pronounced /ə/ (the "o" in "of"). * Combine different alphabets. You could use letters from both Latin and Cyrillic, for example, by using "Я" for the /j/ ("y") sound, and Latin letters for other sounds. * You may also want to use transliterations, also known as romanizations - for example, Russian знаю is transliterated into English as "znayu". This can be very useful if your language does not use the Latin alphabet. 4. Create the vocabulary. These are the words for your language. You should start off by making common words first, and then move on to less common words.center * Start with the foundation words, the words that will be used very often. These are words like "I", "he", "his", "and", "a", "to", and "the". Then move on to verbs such as "to be", "to have", "to like", "to go", and "to make". * Move on to common things. As your vocabulary grows, start naming everything you can think of. Remember countries, body parts, action words, etc. Don't forget numbers! * If you're stumped, remember you can borrow words from other languages. You can even alter the word. For example, the French word for man is homme. The Spanish word—hombre—is almost the same, with only a few letters/the pronunciation changed. * Look through word frequency charts or lists such as the Swadesh list to get an idea of which words you should add first. You should work on more common and basic words first - don't try to make "hypertension" before making "they". 5. Build up your own dictionary. Open the dictionary and begin copying words with their translations. Not only will this be helpful if you forget how to say something, but it will ensure you don't miss a word.center * Try to make the words easily pronounceable and readable—you don't want to be stuck with tongue twisters every time you open your mouth. Simple words should be shorter and simpler - a word like "kesolainotokos" is more likely to mean "volcanic ash" than it is to mean "you". 6. Choose some of your words based on other invented words. For example, if you invented the word 'China' as 'Khinssa', 'Drink' as 'Bever', and the word 'Accident' as 'Casnondelibreaten', why not make the word 'tea' as 'Khincasnonbever'?center 7. Create the word order. These describe how sentences are formed. In English, for example, the word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), while in Japanese, the word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). You'll also have to decide where to put adjectives, possessors, adverbs, etc. You can copy many from existing languages,or you can create your own rules.center 8. Decide how to pluralize nouns. You may want to have a way to tell the difference between "book" and "books". You could choose to add an affix to your words, or double the word to make it plural. You may even choose to omit plurals!center 9. Decide how to create the tenses of the verbs. These will tell when something happened. The three main tenses are past, present, and future.center * You may also want a way to tell the difference between words like "swim" and "swimming". But it's not necessary. For example in the French language, "Je nage" can mean "I swim" or "I am swimming". 10. Create replacements for other suffixes. These are things like -ly, which turns English adjectives into adverbs, and -ness, which turns adjectives into nouns.center 11. Figure out how to conjugate verbs. Conjugation is how a verb is modified according to the subject, tense, mood, voice and aspect. A verb can be conjugated by adding an affix, or using a different word. In English, we say "I like", "I liked", "He likes" and "He liked".center 12. Create cases. A case is a special category of nouns, adjectives, pronouns, participles or numeral which reflects a certain function. If you are going to make a case system, the most basic ones to have are nominative (subject, ex: "I" in "I run"), accusative (direct object, ex: "it" in "he saw it"), and genitive (possessor or "of" case, ex: "world" in "people of the world"). Cases are optional, though, and your conlang may not need a case system. 13. Create declensions for your adjectives.	For example, the adjective "big" means "large" (positive), while "bigger" means "more larger" (comparative) and "biggest" means "most largest" (superlative).

Be prepared mentally. Cold approaching is not a common method for meeting girls to get dates or have sex with them, along with that not many people are comfortable with strangers so there is a good possibility of getting rejected. The rejection can be painful and may be embarrassing(which is nonsense and illogical) however if done properly you will realize this is one of the best ways to meet girls and have a relationship with them. So keep some things in mind before you go out. * Be confident. Its very important that you be confident. Confidence not only is attractive but also gives you courage to approach and carry out a conversation with a girl you just met. Of course its easier said then done but practicing cold approach several times on a regular basis helps build confidence. * Try that rejection doesn't phase you. There's going to be rejections and this may cause you to feel pain, depression and other negative feelings, which is extremely irrational and illogical because you may perceive it as wrong. Think of it this way there are 3.5 billion girls in this world and if few of them reject you, does it mean that there is no one who would like you for who you are? Is this end of the world? Believe that you deserve it. * Don't care what people think about you. Yes its a cliche but very true. There will always be people who would dislike you and what you do. If you felt that what they think is true, You are shooting yourself in the foot and doing a huge disservice to yourself. Remember it matters only if you think it matters. *	This is a method which is out of the norm and could be scary that’s one of the reasons the benefits are great and awesome.

Start with a genuine compliment. After approaching the girl say something like 'Hi, you look cute and I had to talk to you' or 'You are adorable’ or ‘You look pretty' or 'I like your style' or anything to complement her genuinely. Don't beat around the bush but be clear with your intentions right away. This can save you from getting into the "let's just be friends zone" and keep you out of pain in the long run. It’s also a great way to ease the conversation. 2. Be curious and talk to her in the same way you would talk to a new or old friend. * Read and understand your body language, your voice intensity and demeanor etc, 3. Think a little deeper. She may be a random stranger, but if she is a normal 'Human Being' then she very likely hangs out with her friends, has hobbies, works, studies, has a life story, family, music, movies, has other interests, etc.These things may be good enough to make you feel curious about her. In addition if you express your curiosity genuinely, not only it would make her feel special but would also help reduce your 'self-made' awkwardness of the situation. 4. Maintain eye contact. Your eye contact should sub-communicate what you want. Look deep into her eyes, as if piercing her soul, to convey what you want. * It not only conveys that you are a confident person but also helps build attraction with the girl. 5. Smile. Smile comes naturally when you are having fun. It also helps defuse mind-made tension of the cold approach. If she is smiling back in an uncomfortable way or not smiling at all, that's a cue for you to do something to make her feel comfortable. Try these * Shake her hand, ask her something to divert her mind or say something that you find funny For example "you are making me so nervous that my finger nails are sweating". Give her a little tap on her elbows or shoulders every now and then. It is so much effective, try it. People feel comfortable instantly. * If she still gives signs such as looking around, giving you one-word, short answers, then it’s better for you to take the hint and go approach another girl. 6. Have normal, fun conversation.Try to talk to her in the same way how you would talk to a friend(act as if you know the girl) with a little more energy. * Of course use common sense, talking to a friend does not mean you start swearing unnecessarily or be grouchy. If you have a vulgar or sexual sense of humor then express it, but if she does not like it there is a good chance that she is not going to be compatible with you in the long run. 7. Ask her about her interests like ‘what do you do for fun?’ Say things like ‘I am going to assume that you are an artsy person’, or ‘You know I just noticed something about you'.	Keep her curious about yourself too.

Turn the grill on. To steam clean your panini grill, you’ll need to use the heat from the grill itself. If you are cleaning it immediately after using it, you should be able to use the residual heat from the grill. If you are cleaning it after not having used it, turn it on to the lowest heat setting. 2. Thoroughly soak a paper towel or rag. To steam clean your grill, you’ll need to completely soaked towel or rag. Soak a rag in clean, clear water until it drips. Don’t ring it out before you place it on the grill. * Since you’ll be laying this cloth on your grill and closing the lid while the grill is on, the cloth must be completely soaked. Otherwise you risk burning the rag and causing damage to your grill. 3. Lay the rag on the bottom grill. Lay the soaked cloth on the bottom portion of the panini grill. It should completely cover the bottom grill to ensure that the entire grill is steamed. Be sure to keep the cloth away from any exposed electrical components. 4. Close the grill. Once you’ve placed the cloth, close the grill on top of it. You’ll hear sizzling sounds when the grill closes and the wet rag meets the hot top of the grill. Check that the cloth is placed so that it it covers the entirety of the bottom and top parts of the grill. 5. Let the cloth sit for five minutes. You should keep the cloth on the grill for about five minutes. Stay near the grill and keep an eye on it. You should see some steam, but if you see or smell smoke, remove the rag immediately. 6. Open the grill and wipe it down. Open the grill and remove the cloth after five minutes. Most of the caked on residue should now be easier to remove.	.

If you want a subtle way to add sweetness to your foods or drinks without lots of extra calories, this might be a good option. * The FDA generally believes that sugar alcohols are safe for consumption. But, you should keep them away from pets. 2. Use aspartame if you want a widely available product.	This amino acid compound was approved by the FDA over 3 decades ago and continues to be very popular with consumers. It usually comes in tiny granules that are around 180 times sweeter than sugar. A small amount of aspartame goes a long way.

Accept that uniquely shaped or protruding female body parts will attract boys. Girls are built differently from boys and those differences will always attract the opposite sex. Some boys are attracted to boobs, some are attracted to butts, some are attracted to hair, some are attracted to legs, and so on. Of course, many are attracted to all parts of a female. Know that even the butt-obsessed boyfriend really appreciates the total-you, yet has a keen interest in your highly-rated posterior. 2. Know that boys will be attracted and interested in your butt to differing degrees, depending upon their personal makeup. 3. If you have it, flaunt it to a certain extent. Use moderation depending upon the situation. However, just like there are those with great hair or wonderful abs, don't be afraid to present your great butt, since not every girl has a set of developed glutes. When in the mood, wear tight jeans or short shorts, for example, to accentuate your curves, along with shorter tops so as not to hide your hips. 4. Do not argue with your boyfriend about your butt after he has expressed his keen interest in that part of your body. You might have even thought about going on a diet. Take his compliments to heart, thank him for noticing your unique shape, and move on. Later, at home, look at yourself in a full-length mirror, with and without clothes on. You may find that he has good reasons for his attention. 5. Reward your boyfriend for behaving himself in public situations by walking with a wiggle, arching your back or bending over for him in private situations to accentuate your butt.	.

It is okay to remember the good times that you had together. And remember, if you get lonely, your sibling will only be a short phone call away.

Bring chocolate. Chocolate—especially dark chocolate—helps boost serotonin levels, which helps lower stress. Salmon is good for depression too, they say, but who wants to be comforted by cold fish? 2. Let them get all their anger out. Let them cry and sob. Let them punch and scream into pillows, or write something down in a notebook. * Don't say "don't cry," or make them feel foolish—chances are, they already do. 3. Be totally on their side. Say it's the other person's loss. Tell your friend that the ex is not worth it, they're better off without that person, they deserve better, etc. * After the initial shock of loss, people are generally happier when a bad relationship ends. Nobody needs that kind of baggage in their day-to-day life. 4. Take them out on the town. Show them a good time and help them get their ex out of their mind for a while. 5. Show them the light. Encourage them to think about the positive aspects of their break up—more freedom, the chance to meet a new person for a fresh and exciting relationship, more money to spend on themselves, nobody to answer to—the list goes on. 6. Give them something to look forward to. Tell them that many great works of art have been born out of pain and anguish—especially the kind of pain and anguish visited upon us by our (former) boyfriends or girlfriends. * If they're not creative, then suggest that they become creative in order to express the way they feel—even if their medium of choice is the paintball gun! * Talking is good—and a form of creativity—but it's good to write, sing, paint, etc. If they have any hobbies or passions, then suggest they immerse themselves in them for a while. There's nothing better for the healing process than feeling that the blow you've suffered has actually had a positive outcome. 7. Take them for a long walk, or to the gym. Say that her ex will feel like a loser when he sees her hot new body—and the admiring looks she's getting. Even more important is the proven positive effect that exercise has on the body and mind. 8. Don't blame them all.	Not everyone is evil, when just one person hurts you.

Don't listen to people who say it’s “in your head.” You can’t just “get over”anxious feelings. Your anxiety is not completely under your control, so anyone who tells you otherwise is being insensitive. To avoid playing into negative perceptions like that, try to get distance from people who are not understanding or supportive or your condition. 2. Confide in someone you trust. Talking about your anxiety may help you release stress and feel more connected with others. Share what you’re going through with someone who is trustworthy and supportive. This might be a parent, sibling, close friend, a teacher, or community member. 3.	Being around the right kind of people can dramatically lift your spirits and help you feel more capable of getting through the tough days. Seek out friendships with people who care about you and your well-being.

Take out a piece of rough paper and list the rows from 1-10. Then, before you hit the books, brainstorm 10 'pros' on why you should concentrate. Don't even think about the 'cons', because you'll never come up with the 'pros' if you think about the 'cons'. And, list out the objectives that you'll achieve after your studies. This will help you concentrate as you will get what you want or achieve something from the 'pros'. 2. Get everything you need for your revision, pencil, eraser, pen, sharpener, etc within your reach so that you are not distracted while studying. * Have a snack that is filling, e.g. peanut butter crackers. This will help your mind stay focused. Don't drink coffee, tea, or any other energy drinks. It will make you feel tired. 3. Make a timetable. You can't really concentrate if you read, read, and read again for 24 hours straight. The best thing is 30-60 minute periods with 5-15 minute breaks in between. Get the most important things done first. Don't waste time trying to remember everything. Take it one step at a time, there's no need to rush. 4. Prepare a full set of rough paper, note sheets, stationery, and files. Have your books and some reference titles nearby. Don't hop up in the middle of revision to get anything as it may be very distracting. 5. If you can't seem to get yourself to study, think about what you'll do when you grow up. Do you want to get a good job as a engineer, doctor, lawyer or work in a dairy or the gas station? 6. Learn how to make mind-maps which can really help during revision. Use colour pencils and illustrations to make the mind map more interesting. 7. You must have a quiet place to study with a bottle of water to keep you energised and proper lighting in your room.	As entertaining as the show looks, you must not let your mind drift to the television program, which is why you should do your homework in a quiet place without distractions.

Try wearing mascara or interesting glasses to draw attention to your eyes instead of your teeth. * Be expressive with your eyes, especially when smiling.

Try to direct attention to parts of your appearance you feel confident about instead of your teeth. * Wear attractive earrings. A pair with sparkle or dangle will do a great job of drawing attention. * Get an alluring haircut. Try styles with a dramatic cut or bold color to focus attention on your hair. 4. Try a teeth whitening product. Making your teeth a bit whiter may help you feel more confident about your smile, even if you have other dental issues. There are many whitening products you can try: * Whitening toothpastes are easy and not expensive. * Whitening gels come with trays to hold the gel against your teeth. These can be more expensive, especially if you get custom trays shaped to your teeth. * Whitening strips stick onto your teeth to whiten them. You may have to use these repeatedly and the cost can add up. 5. Smile without showing your teeth. Many people smile like this anyway so if you don't want people to see your teeth give it a try. * Practice smiling different ways in the mirror. *	.

Write the word you referenced first. Capitalize the first letter of the word and place a period after the end of the word. For example, if you looked up the word "crepuscular," you would just write: Crepuscular. * If you used the dictionary to cite multiple words, do not use this method. Instead of citing individual entries, cite the entire dictionary instead. 2. Place the year of publication in parentheses. Follow the parentheses with a period. You can find the year of publication by looking on the copyright page of a physical book. Online, check the "About" page or look at the bottom of the website. * If you cannot find a date, put "n.d." instead. This stands for "no date." 3. Put the full title of the dictionary in italics. Write the word “In” before the dictionary’s title but do not italicize it. Do not put any punctuation after the title of the dictionary. For example, your citation may now look like this: * Crepuscular. (2017). In Oxford English Dictionary 4. Add the edition of the dictionary in parentheses. Put the number of the edition followed by “ed.” in the parentheses. Place a period after the parentheses. If you cannot find which edition it is, you may skip this part. Your citation may now look like: * Crepuscular. (2017). In Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed.). 5. Include the page numbers if you are citing a physical book. Include the full range of pages for the entry you are citing. Write "pp." before the pages. Include these in the parentheses with the edition number. If you do not have an edition number, place the page numbers in parentheses after the title of the dictionary. * A reference with both the edition and page numbers would look like this: * Crepuscular. (2017). In Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed., pp.1005-1006). * A reference with just the page numbers would look like this: * Crepuscular. (2017). In Oxford English Dictionary (pp.1005-1006). * If you used a website, you do not need to include page numbers. Simply skip this part. 6. Write the city of publication. If it was published in the US, include both the city and the state. After the location, put a colon. Your reference may now look like: * Crepuscular. (2017). In Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed., pp.1005-1006). Oxford: 7. Finish the reference with the name of the publisher. Put a period after the name of the publisher. You can find the publisher on the copyright page for a physical book. If it is an online dictionary, look at the bottom of the page or on the “About” page. A finished citation may look like: * Crepuscular. (2017). In Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed., pp.1005-1006). Oxford: Oxford University Press. 8. Replace the place of publication with a URL to cite an online dictionary. Write “Retrieved from” before the URL. Paste the entire URL to the end of the citation and put a period afterwards. Use a short URL (sometimes known as a permanent URL) instead of a long URL if possible.	.

Write the last name and first initials of the editors. The last name always goes first in an APA citation. Separate a list of names with commas and place an “&” before the last name. In parentheses after the name, write “ed.” to signify that this is the editor of the dictionary. * Remember to put a period after the parentheses. For example, if you were citing the Oxford English Dictionary, it would start with: * Simpson, J. (ed.). * If there is more than one editor use “eds.” instead of “ed.” For example, it might look like, * Rice, L. & Hilbert, R. (eds.). * If the dictionary does not include the names of its editors, leave this part blank. You will start the citation with the name of the dictionary instead. 2. Place the year of publication in parentheses. Place a period outside of the parentheses. For a book, this can be found on the copyright page. For a website, it is usually on the bottom of the webpage. The reference may now look like this: * Simpson, J. (ed.). (2017). 3. Italicize the full name of the dictionary. Do not put any punctuation after the name of the dictionary. In the citation for the Oxford English Dictionary, it would now look like: * Simpson, J. (ed.). (2017). Oxford English Dictionary 4. Put the edition number in parentheses. After the edition number write “ed.”, which stands for edition. After the parentheses, place a period. So in the citation for Oxford English Dictionary, you may have: * Simpson, J. (ed.). (2017). Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed.). 5. Write the city of publication and the publisher at the end. If it was published in the US, write the state as well. Separate the city and state with a comma. After the place of publication, put a colon. Write out the name of the publisher after the colon. * Simpson, J. (ed.). (2017). Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. 6. Start with the name of the dictionary if you do not have an editor. In many cases, you may not be able to locate the editor of the dictionary. In this case, start with the name of the dictionary. Write the year in parentheses between the edition number and the place of publication.	.

This means that a company cannot discriminate against blind people in any area of employment including, hiring, firing, training, etc. Employers are also responsible for making small adjustments to work conditions, or reasonable accommodations, for the benefit of people with disabilities. * Reasonable accommodation means making changes to the work environment or application process so that blind or visually impaired people have equal access to employment. Specific accommodations may include: * Changes in lighting (natural, halogen, fluorescent). * Use of large print or braille on documents or signs. * Use of electronic voice messages in place of written communication. * A human assistant to help with written tasks or other visual communication. * Changes in work schedule to accommodate for public transportation. * Sharing or switching assignments with other employees. *	For example, an employer may not ask, “How severe is your condition?” However, they can ask, “Are you able to read data files?”

Talk to the bride about the guest list. Unless the shower is a surprise, it is a good idea to get as much input as possible from the bride. Traditionally, a bridal shower is for the bride, her bridesmaids, and other close female friends and family. She may want to stick to this tradition or she may want to include older family members, children, or even partners of her friends. * This is valuable information when choosing a theme and deciding on your decorations. If there are going to be children there, for example, you will want to avoid decorating with precious, breakable items within their reach. You might also consider creating a designated space for them to gather and play. 2. Determine the shower's location. The bride may feel strongly about hosting an event-style shower like a spa day or a horseback riding trip. Decorations for this type of shower are minimal and need to be portable and simple, so this is an important distinction to make up front. * An event shower will save you money on decorations, but they are generally more expensive all around. The host is responsible for organizing the details, but the cost is generally split evenly between all of the participants except the bride. 3. Select a theme for the shower to give your decorations a focus. This is optional and depends on the interests, style, and desires of the bride. Unless the shower is a surprise, ask the bride about her thoughts on a theme. * When you discuss the theme with the bride, watch for her level of interest and enthusiasm when you discuss certain ideas. For example, she may not care very much about the colors you choose, but she suddenly becomes passionate when you talk about the flowers or a make-your-own cocktail bar. * If the bride-to-be is stressed out, consider a spa day or a less expensive at-home self-care day that includes pedicures, facials, and yummy smoothies. * For a movie buff, choose a film genre inspired shower that includes champagne, popcorn, and several great movies. 4. Choose a color palette or style for your decorations if you don’t select a theme. Even if you and the bride decide you don't want to adhere to a theme, designating colors and/or a particular style of décor can help keep your choices focused and coherent. Think of visual styles like shabby chic, rustic/nature, or modern art. * If the bride is a French wine enthusiast, consider a French country look for your decorations. * When in doubt, choose the colors of the wedding for the shower decorations. * Pick the bride’s favorite color and create your look using different shades of that color with splashes of white mixed in. 5. Stick to your budget. It is easy to go overboard on spending, especially when the party is for a beloved friend on a special occasion. That’s why it is important to decide on an amount you are comfortable spending on decorations at the outset. Make sure you take into consideration any additional costs: food, alcohol, invitations, catering, or housecleaning just to name a few. * It is perfectly acceptable to ask several other guests to co-host with you and share the expense. * Pick one thing that you think the bride would really appreciate and splurge on that.	.

It is not a natural move and makes your body, neck and head feel vulnerable. Visualization and adequate training are the best tools for overcoming fear. * You need to be able to confidently perform simple moves such as a forward roll, backwards roll, handstand, cartwheel, round-off, front walkover, back walkover, and back handspring before attempting the back-flip. These skills provide you with the strength and balance needed to perform a back-flip. * If you find yourself over-rotating, lean your shoulders forward. * Be sure to set high and tuck fast(grab your knees tight like a cannonball) with your chin up for maximum rotation speed and time. *	If you do this, however, make sure you are not going to hit your head on the diving board and that the pool is of proper depth. Water may be more forgiving than concrete when you are conscious but a head injury can easily cause you to pass out and drown.

Understand the liberal way the Dutch government deals with drugs. Drugs (apart from alcohol and cigarettes) are illegal in the Netherlands. But the Dutch make a difference between so called 'hard drugs' and 'soft drugs'. 2. Know that heroine, cocaine, meth, crack and the likes, are considered 'hard drugs'. Very illegal to produce, to trade, to traffic, to own and to buy. The Dutch government has an active policy of fighting anything to do with these drugs and you will be prosecuted if you are caught in any of those activities. To use them is also illegal, but you will very rarely be prosecuted for the use in itself. As a drugs-addict, you will be seen as someone that needs help. Part of the help you can get as a heroin addict, for instance, is that you will be allowed in a rehab-program where the government provides you with Methadon, a much less harmful substitute. This is to prevent addicts from having to go out stealing and robbing to get money to pay for their 'fix'. 3. Know that cannabis (weed, hasjies, joints, spacecake and such) and to a certain extend 'party-drugs' like XTC, are as illegal as hard drugs in every aspect.	That is because they are considered to be much less addictive and harmful then hard drugs. To prevent common citizens having to engage in dangerous criminal activities for a 'bit of fun' with which they can only harm themselves, you will not be prosecuted for owning or using these drugs for personal use.

Call the municipal government to verify digging the area is safe. If you're digging in a suburban or even semi-rural area, you should first consult your local utilities authority about the underground utilities layout. Digging into the layout isn't just disruptive but potentially lethal if your shovel comes in contact with anything electrical. Even in the mildest cases, a lot of hassle can be bypassed if you contact the proper authorities first. Remember the words: "Call before you dig." * If you're looking for the right number to call, you can Google search "dig hole" and your city or municipality. The proper authority should come up in the first or second listing. 2. Spray a hole outline. If your hole is going to be any bigger than a post, it is good to first have an outline of how big you'd like the hole to be. Without a line, diggers have the tendency to miscalculate how big their finished hole should be. With a can of marking spray paint, spray the area you would like to have dug up. Be generous with the size; it's usually better to have a hole that's slightly too big than one too small for your needs. * If you're digging post holes, you should run a straight string along the area you'd like to see fenced and spray markers or drive marker stakes in to the ground at consistent intervals across the line. 3. Gather the right supplies for the job. Due to how many different types and sizes of holes can be dug, there's all-encompassing list to turn to if you want to know what equipment you'll need.	While most of the work may be one with a shovel, other instruments may speed up the process. Though you may ant to get the biggest tools available for efficiency's sake, getting something smaller dependent on your body size will keep you from tiring out quickly, thus improving efficiency in the long run.

Find_the_Inverse_of_a_Quadratic_Function.txt	## Steps	Make x the subject of the formula .	## Steps	Then , make x the subject of the formula .	<insert><Then><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Make><1><make><3>	Steps  1. Make y or f(x) the subject of the formula if it isn't already. During your algebraic manipulation, make sure that you do not change the function in any way and perform the same operations to both "sides" of the equation. 2. Rearrange the function so that it is in the form y=a(x-h)+k. This is not only essential for you to find the inverse of the function, but also for you to determine whether the function even has an inverse. You can do this by two methods: * By completing the square 1. "Take common" from the whole equation the value of a (the coefficient of x). Do this by writing the value of a, starting a bracket, and writing the whole equation, then dividing each term by the value of a, as shown in the diagram on the right. Leave the left hand side of the equation untouched, as there has been no net change to the right hand side. 2. Complete the square. The coefficient of x is (b/a). Halve it, to give (b/2a), and square it, to give (b/2a). Add and subtract it from the equation. This will have no net effect on the equation. If you look closely, you will see that the first three terms inside the bracket are in the form a+2ab+b, where a is x, and b is (b/2a). Of course these two values will be numerical, rather than algebraical for a real equation. This is a completed square. 3. Because the first three terms are now a perfect square, you can write them in the form (a-b) or (a+b). The sign between the two terms will be the same as the sign of the coefficient of x in the equation. 4. Take the term which is outside the perfect square out of the square bracket. This brings the equation into the form y=a(x-h)+k, as intended. * By comparing coefficients 1. Form an identity in x. On the left, put the function as it is expressed in terms of x, and on the right put the function in the form that you want it to be, in this case a(x-h)+k. This will enable you to find out the values of a, h, and k that are true for all values of x. 2. Open and expand the bracket on the right hand side of the identity. We shall not be touching the left hand side of the equation, and may omit it from our working. Note that all working on the right hand side is algebraical as shown and not numerical. 3. Identify the coefficients of each power of x. Then group them and place them in brackets, as shown on the right. 4. Compare the coefficients of each power of x. The coefficient of x on the right hand side must equal that on the left hand side. This gives the value of a. The coefficient of x on the right hand side also must equal that on the left hand side. This leads to the formation of an equation in a and h, which can be solved by substituting the value of a, which has already been found. The coefficient of x, or 1, on the left hand side must also equal that on the right hand side. Comparing them yields an equation that will help us find the value of k. 5. Using the values of a,h, and k found above, we can write the equation in the desired form. 3. Determine that the value of h is either on the boundary of the domain, or outside it. The value of h gives the x-coordinate of the turning point of the equation. A turning point within the domain would mean that the function is not one-one, and hence does not have an inverse. Note that the equation is a(x-h)+k. Thus if there is (x+3) inside the bracket, the value of h is negative 3. 4. Make (x-h) the subject of your formula. Do this by subtracting the value of k from both sides of the equation, and then dividing both sides of the equation by a. By now you will have numerical values for a,h, and k, so use those, not the symbols. 5. Square-Root both sides of the equation. This will remove the power of two from (x-h). Do not forget to put the "+/-" sign on the other side of the equation. 6. Decide between the + and the - sign, as you can not have both (having both would make it a one to many "function", which would make it invalid as the same). For this, look at the domain. If the domain lies to the left of the stationary point i.e. x  a certain value, use the + sign. 7.	.

Preheat your oven, and when it’s ready, put your panettone cubes in and let them bake for 10 minutes, or until their edges are gold and crispy. Allow them to cool completely. * If you want, do these steps ahead of time and store your panettone cubes in an airtight container until you’re ready to make your stuffing. 3. Chop 2 onions and 3 stalks of celery into small pieces. You want your pieces to be small, but not so small that they’ll be mushy when you cook them. Begin warming a large sautee pan on the stove for the next step. 4. Sautee your chopped onions and celery with oil for 10 minutes. Add the oil to your sautee pan and let it warm. Add your chopped vegetables and cook them for 10 minutes. Stir them frequently to prevent any of the sides from burning. 5. Add Italian sausage and oil to your pan. When your vegetables have cooked for 10 minutes, add sausage and oil to the pan. Cook the sausage for 10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces as you stir it to allow it to cook evenly. 6. Combine your panettone cubes and sausage mixture in a baking dish. When your sausage is fully cooked, remove the mixture from the stove and spoon it into your baking dish. Add your toasted panettone cubes and stir everything together in the dish. 7. Whisk 4 eggs in a bowl and add chicken broth. Crack 4 eggs into a separate bowl and whisk them until the whites and yolks are combined. Taste your chicken broth and add salt to it until you feel it’s salty enough.	.

Compare the cost of the extended warranty against the cost of the product. If the cost of the warranty is more than 30 percent of the product cost, then it may not be worth it. Sometimes it just makes more sense to replace the product. For example, an iron or a coffee machine may not deserve a warranty, whereas a fridge or oven probably would. Therefore, weight the cost of the warranty against the product, and decide if you think it's worth it. 2. Understand what the warranty covers before buying it. Some warranties will cover parts only, or they will cover for labor only. Read the fine print and weigh warranty specifics against the product. If everything is covered, then it might be worth purchasing. Only you can determine what may be necessary to cover.	But if the television already comes with some form of warranty and the extended warranty only covers labor, then it may not be worth the additional payment. Whatever the terms, make sure you get the details in writing should you choose to purchase it.

Check for local restrictions on steelhead fishing. Steelhead are often considered a pest, and there aren’t usually any limits on how many you can catch. However, some areas have endangered populations of steelhead, partially due to their popularity as fishing game. To check local restrictions, contact your local government’s department of fishing or wildlife. In addition, some states only allow steelhead fishing at certain times of the year or in certain bodies of water. 2. Fish for steelhead in river seams when the weather is warm. A seam is the location where the flow of water is diverted by an object or current and continues in a different direction, creating a border between 2 different layers of water. Look for seams by following the surface of water as it flows off of an object and continues down the stream or river in a new direction. Steelhead consistently rest in river seams where the current bounces off of a rock, obstruction, or competing current. They hang out in the seam to rest a side of their body while swimming upstream. * You will often see a small line of rough waters shifting in between 2 calmer areas at the exact location of a seam. 3. Fish in the late spring and early summer to catch steelhead migrating.	In some areas, the winter spawns are better for catching steelhead. Check with your local department of wildlife for information about steelhead spawning schedules in your particular geographic region.

Express_Love_when_You're_Autistic.txt	### Communicating with Your Partner	You might want to create a little routine for whenever you see your partner at school .	### Communicating with Your Partner	For example , you might want to create a little routine for whenever you see your partner at school .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><You><1><you><4>	Communicating with Your Partner  1. Compliment your partner. Sincere compliments are one of the best ways to show that you love someone. As an autistic person, you may notice small details that someone else would not. These compliments make your partner feel loved. * Try to steer away from generic or superficial compliments. Everyone likes to be told they are beautiful or handsome, but more personal compliments will set them apart as expressions of love. * Try to compliment your partner's behavior more than their appearance. These compliments mean more because they are something more in your partner's control. * For example, you might say "I loved the way you helped that old woman cross the street. It showed how conscientious and caring you are, and that's one of my favorite things about you." 2. Ask about friends or interests. Pay attention to what interests your partner, and ask them questions about those things. You also want to ask questions about other people your partner has close relationships with, such as friends and family members. * If you've developed a close personal relationship, it's likely you have at least one (if not several) interests in common. Talking about those interests reinforces that connection. * But asking about things in which they're interested shows that you care about them – even if you don't share the interest. The less interested you are in the particular thing, the more it shows that you care about your partner if you ask about it. * Asking about your partner's friends or family members not only shows you love your partner, but gives you the opportunity to learn about them and the people they care about. 3. Encourage openness. Open communication is crucial in any relationship, but it can be especially crucial if you are autistic and don't express yourself in the same way other people do, or have difficulty reading body language and other subtle signals. * Both you and your partner have to be willing to talk about things that are bothering you and what you expect from each other in the relationship. * One of the most important things your partner needs to understand is that they can't assume that you know what to do or what to say in any given situation. * They also can't assume that you understand what they need out of the relationship, or that your needs will be the same or even similar. * Because you may have difficulty being able to intuit when something's wrong or when your partner is upset, you must be able to talk to each other clearly and openly about basically any situation. 4. Write your partner little love notes. It may be difficult for you to verbalize your thoughts or communicate your feelings in person. However, if you can take a little time to compose a short love note, your partner can keep it with them all day. * Spontaneity is important in romantic relationships, but you may have difficulty being spontaneous if you're autistic. * The idea of doing something without planning ahead may cause you tremendous anxiety. However, keep in mind that something doesn't need to be spontaneous for you to be spontaneous for your partner. * For example, you can write a short love note for your partner and leave it in an unexpected, random location where they're sure to see it, such as taped to the bathroom mirror or the rearview mirror of their car. * Don't wait for a holiday or special occasion. You can write these notes for no reason at all and leave them in places where your partner will find them. 5. Develop your own language. As you and your partner get to know each other and become closer, you may develop "code words" that evolve into a language all your own. You can use these code words to communicate on a very intimate level. * Think about how couples have special nicknames or terms of endearment for each other. Your code words can be similar to this. * You might create your own word or phrase to say that you want to leave a place or want to get something to eat. * These code words have the added benefit that you can use them in public and no one around will really understand what you're talking about. * This can be ideal if you are feeling overstimulated and need to get out of a situation as quickly as possible. 6. Create your own routine. Most autistic people thrive when they have a set routine and rules to follow. A neurotypical person might dismiss the idea of scheduling affection as "cold," but it can help you to express love when you're autistic. * For example, suppose you and your partner go to school together, and sometimes see each other on campus between classes. *	Figure out when your classes are and where you'll be so you can schedule times to see each other.

Base your explanation in the present. As your child gets older, you can build upon the same things you’ve already been teaching them. They’ll have more sophisticated questions, which will require more thorough answers.	You don’t need to give them a lengthy history lesson about race relations (hopefully their history class is doing that). Instead, you can explain that it is a protest against injustice. Use examples like instances of police brutality to help them understand what people are protesting.

Explain injustice to school aged children. By the time they are in elementary school, your kids will be getting a lot of messages about race. They’ll hear it on television from politicians, celebrities, and athletes. Explain to them that sometimes people use racism to limit other people’s power. Use examples that are age appropriate so that your child will understand. * Use an activity to demonstrate inequality. If you have a group of kids, hand out a treat (a piece of candy, stickers, a quarter, etc.) Give some kids more than others. Ask them how it feels to have less. * Explain that in the US, a lot kids have less than others because of racial inequalities. They might have less resources at school, or no access to fresh fruits and vegetables, if they don't live near a decent grocery store. * Indicate that this is just one example of racism. It happens everywhere, and in lots of different ways. * Afterwards, give out more treats until everyone has the same amount, and discuss how it feels better when it's fair. 2. Teach upper elementary age kids about structural oppression. Once you feel your child can understand complex issues, give a more thorough explanation of social injustice. For example, you could start by talking about the history of racial oppression in the US. You could use housing discrimination to illustrate your point. * Explain that sometimes people oppress other people so that they can't make economic advances. * You could say, "You know how Grandma has security because she owns a nice house in a nice neighborhood? Well, in the 1930s, she got money from the government to help her buy it. Lots of white families did. But at the same time, African Americans were not given money. Then, the banks refused to lend them money, too." * Make sure to explain that racist oppression leads to further racist oppression. For instance, you can say, "Because they had to pay more for worse houses, African Americans couldn't save as much money. Living in worse neighborhoods meant they weren't able to choose which school the kids went to, or get certain jobs." * Ask your child what questions they have, and make sure that they understand that social injustice is still a part of our society. 3. Explain the basics of race in a positive, factual manner. It's natural for your child to be curious, and they might get confused or have questions sometimes. Speak calmly and positively, the same way you might explain how people have different hair or eye colors. This helps them learn that racial diversity is nothing to hide or be afraid of. * For example, "Yes, some people have light skin, some have dark skin, and some have medium-colored skin. There are lots of different skin colors, and all of them are good colors!" * Teach them the words for what they see. Being able to label race helps them understand that it's nothing to be embarrassed about. For example, "Mommy is Asian and Daddy is Native American, and you are both! How cool is that?" 4. Talk about your family's racial heritage. For instance, if your kids are black, you want them to talk and think about what it means to be black, for example.	You can give them examples of what is unique and beautiful about their heritage.

Take hints -- if the noble uses a casual style of conversation, drop the "Sir" or "Ma'am." Don't make them have to ask. 3. These are just people. Don't fawn. It makes a bad impression. 4. Queens and Kings are addressed as "Your Majesty." 5. Introduce them to someone else as, e.g. "Her Majesty the Queen" (adding "Of England" if this is not clear from context). 6. Formal introductions, e.g. an announcement as they enter a party, are longer. But they have people with them whom you can ask for the correct wording, if the occasion arises. 7. Princes and Princesses are called "Your Royal Highness." 8. Introduce them as, e.g. "His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales." 9. Any child or grandchild of a monarch is considered a prince or princess. 10. The spouse of a prince or princess is also a prince or princess. 11. A great-grandchild of a king or queen is not considered a prince or princess, but they are still a Lord or Lady. Address them as, e.g. "Lady Jane" and introduce them as "Lady Jane Windsor" (unless they have a different title of their own). 12. Dukes and Duchesses are called "Your Grace" or "Duke/Duchess." 13. Introduce the duke to someone else as, e.g. "His Grace the Duke of Norfolk," the duchess as "Her Grace the Duchess of Norfolk." 14. Except as listed below, other forms of nobility are addressed as, e.g. "Lord/Lady Towlebridge" (for the Earl of Towlebridge), and introduced the same way. You wouldn't normally give their exact rank during an introduction. 15. A peer's wife is introduced as "Lady Towlebridge" (not "Lady Honoria Towlebridge," which would imply that she has some other rank). 16. Particularly in the higher ranks, it is often the case that the person's surname is different from their title. This is the distinction between "Earl Creeley" (whose surname is Creeley) and "Earl of Towlebridge" (whose surname is something else). 17. An Earl is equivalent to the rank of Count in other countries. The wife of an Earl is a Countess. 18. A baronet is the same as a knight except that a knighthood can't be inherited. Address a knight or baronet as "Sir Ralph" (if his name is Ralph Sweet), and his wife as "Lady Sweet". Introduce him using his full name, "Sir Ralph Sweet," and his wife as "Lady Sweet." 19. Women can also be knights. Women knights come in two varieties, "Lady" and "Dame." Like male knights, address them by their title and first name, e.g. "Dame Edith" or "Lady Sarah". Introduce a lady knight as "Lady Sarah Blythe" or "Dame Edith Wheeler." 20. Baronetess is a separate title -- it doesn't mean the wife of a baronet.	.

Determine if you are eligible to take a tax deduction for donating your car to charity. A tax deduction reduces the amount of your taxable income, thereby lowering the total amount of taxes you pay, making you cash. The charitable donation deduction on your federal income tax return is located on Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Form 1040 Schedule A - Itemized Deductions (“Schedule A”). You may itemize deductions on Schedule A or take your standard deduction. Taxpayers should normally take whichever amount is higher. To determine if you are eligible to take a tax deduction: * Complete Schedule A. Read the Schedule A Instructions and follow them carefully. If you need assistance with this, you can contact a licensed tax attorney, certified public accountant (“CPA”) or IRS Enrolled Agent for help. * Compare the total itemized deduction amount on Schedule A line 29 to your standard deduction amount, located on IRS Form 1040 (“Form 1040), page 2, in the left margin. * If the amount on Schedule A is higher than your standard deduction, you are eligible to take a tax deduction for donating your car to charity. 2. If you are eligible for a tax deduction, make a list of all local charities. You can find nearby charities by: * Looking in your phone book. Check the yellow pages under ‘Charitable Organizations’ for a listing of local charities. * Doing an online search. Use your favorite search engine to search ‘charitable organizations’ or ‘charities’ and then narrow the search to your local area by including your location, for example “charitable organizations” and “Indianapolis”. * Using a charity guide or database. Several organizations offer searchable databases of charitable organizations.	.

If you are standing outside a classroom waiting to enter, go up to her and say hello, or hi. Ask her out, and then ask her for her phone number (But only if she looks like she is able to get out a piece of paper and write down her number.) If she likes you, she would probably say yes. 5.

Comb out your hair and apply a product. If your hair is naturally curly, use a curl-defining gel. If you have naturally wavy hair, try mousse. For straight hair, go for curl-enhancing gel. 3. Dry your hair. You can let your hair air-dry or dry it with a diffuser, lifting your hair at the roots to encourage volume. 4. Divide your hair into two sections along your part. You can use a center or side part, whichever you prefer for styling. * Tie off the section you won't be working on first into a loose ponytail. 5. Separate a 2-inch piece of hair from the back of the loose section. Start from the back of your head and grasp a small section from the lowest layers. 6. Wrap the hair around a heated curling iron or wand. Start from the root of your hair and the tip of the curling iron. Wind the hair around the iron, gradually wrapping down to the base of the iron (where the handle is). * Note that your hair is not clamped into the curling iron or wand, but rather twisted around the barrel. 7. Hold the curler with the strand in place for at least ten seconds. Avoid holding it for too long - you don't want to fry your hair! * You may need to experiment with how long to hold your hair around the iron, as this varies depending on hair type. 8. Repeat the curling process for the remainder of the section. Work from back to front, starting with the lower layers and finishing with the upper. 9. Untie the other section and repeat the curling process with it. Move the section you've already curled to the front of your shoulder to keep it out of the way. 10. Work your fingers gently through your curls.	If the curls are tighter than you wanted, keep in mind that within a few hours they'll relax a bit.

The heat from the iron heats up the barrel just enough to curl your hair. 5. Close the flat iron and twist away from your face. Make just one twist. 6. Slowly draw the iron downwards to the roots. Hold the twist you made in the previous step and gradually pass the rest of your hair through it. * You may need to experiment with how slowly you go here. Holding the flat iron longer at the top ensures a full curl, rather than just curls at the ends. The longer you hold, the more curl you'll get. * Don't open the iron at any point here: it should remain clamped shut. 7. Repeat Steps 3-6 with the rest of your hair. Work in small sections. 8. Run a pick or your fingers through your hair.	.
Hold_a_Guinea_Pig.txt	### Picking Up a Guinea Pig	Keep the environment calm .	### Picking Up a Guinea Pig	Also , keep the environment calm .	<insert><Also><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Keep><1><keep><3>	Picking Up a Guinea Pig  1. Let them acclimate to you. Don't grab your guinea pig out of the cage the first day you have it. Instead, take a few days to let her get accustomed to you. Put your hand in the cage, and let her smell you. Softly stroke your animal so she learns to trust you. * In fact, it's best to leave your guinea pig completely alone for the first day or two. Cover the cage up with a light blanket that still lets in light. Your guinea pig will feel more safe and secure. After that, you can move on to the acclimation process. 2. Use a towel. If you're worried about your clothes, have a towel ready to put under the guinea pig while holding it. Your guinea pig may not go to the bathroom while on you, but you should be prepared. 3. Be calm. If you're nervous, your guinea pig will pick up on it. Make sure you are calm and collected before you try to hold your guinea pig. 4. Use the cage to your advantage. To catch your guinea pig, you need to gently trap it in the cage. One easy way to catch one is to trap it in a piped area of the cage and then pull it out. Put your hand out to encourage the guinea pig into the pipe, making sure to block the other side. 5. Slip one hand under the guinea pig. Using one hand, slide it under the belly of your guinea pig. Gently start lifting her. 6. Pick the guinea pig up with two hands. Your guinea pig will feel more secure if you use both hands to pick her up. She may feel like she's falling if you only pick her up with one hand. Use your second hand to support the guinea pig's back end. 7. Be firm but gentle. Make sure you have a solid grip on your guinea pig. Otherwise, he may jump from your hands. However, don't squeeze too hard, as you can hurt your guinea pig. 8. Place the guinea pig against your chest. Your towel should be on your chest. Hold her against your chest with her feet towards your body. 9. Talk to your guinea pig. Use a soothing voice to talk to your guinea pig while you're holding it. It doesn't really matter what you say, as long as you use a soothing voice. 10.	You should limit loud noises and sudden movements while your guinea pig is out. You don't want to startle her.

Easy bruising. The lowered red blood cell count and abnormal cells cause the blood to break down more easily, and thus if you hit yourself, the bruise is likely to turn more purple and affect a bigger area than usual. 2. Fatigue. Due to the impaired circulatory system, your body has to work harder to keep you healthy, naturally making you more tired. 3. Weight loss and loss of appetite. This symptom does not have a chance of occuring until late into MDS, when your body starts to weaken and is not getting the nutrients it needs. 4. Petechiae. Petechiae is tiny red dots that form under the skin due to minor internal bleeding. Petechiae can look like a rash and does not lose color when you press on it. 5. Fever. Like most sicknesses, fever comes from your body working hard to fight off the disease and overheating. 6. Frequent infections. If you find that you are more sick more often, that is because MDS impairs your immune system, allowing more viruses and flus to sneak their way in. 7. Weakness.	With less red blood cells, not enough blood is getting everywhere through the body fast enough.
Get_Followers_on_Pinterest.txt	## Steps	Do n't just pin stuff that you like and not many people like .	## Steps	But , do n't just pin stuff that you like and not many people like .	<insert><But><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Do><1><do><3>	Steps  1. Follow famous people. Pop stars have lots of followers. If you follow them, they can follow you back. Or the better: the super fans look at all of their followers and follow them so they can have the same followers as that person. A little weird, but sometimes it happens. 2. Pin lots of pins according to most people's interests. This requires looking at random people's boards so you know what they like. Then search only some to re-pin so you have an idea, but then add your own pins and add them to your boards that people haven't seen before, so that they like you and follow you. 3. At the few followers you may have, see if they have lots of followers. If they have around 200, then that means people like the stuff they pin. Look at the stuff they have on their boards. Do you like it? Then pin it! If they have over 1000 followers, then it'd be a good idea to automatically follow them. But remember-people with only a few followers doesn't mean they have bad pins. They might be new, looking for followers. 4. Make your boards and pins unique.	Don't pin popular stuff either. People always see popular stuff. Make it your own, and even offer links to stuff!

Calculate and purchase at least the total length of gutters needed, as well as the correct number of necessary downspouts, and attachment brackets. Gutters should be attached to the fascia and run the entire length of the roof, ending with a downspout. If a gutter run will measure longer than 40 feet (12 meters), the gutter should be positioned to pitch down from the middle, aimed toward a downspout at each end. A fascia bracket will be attached to every other rafter tail, or approximately every 32 inches (81 cm). 2. Measure and snap a layout line using a chalk line. * Locate the starting point, or highest point, of the gutter run. * Mark the point on the fascia, 1.25 inches (3.175 cm) below the roof flashing. * Mark the low end point on the fascia, while calculating the slope of the gutter at .25 inches (.635 cm) for every 10 feet (3 meters) of length. * Snap a chalk line between the two points. *	.

Know_If_Your_Knuckle_Is_Broken.txt	### Assessing the Immediate Situation	You should still stop using your hand as you could further injure your knuckle .	### Assessing the Immediate Situation	However , you should still stop using your hand as you could further injure your knuckle .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><You><1><you><3>	Assessing the Immediate Situation  1. Experience a popping sensation. People who break knuckles often report feeling a popping or snapping sensation in their hand the moment the break occurs. The snapping feeling can be caused by the actual breaking of the bone or pieces of the bone popping out of their original place. If you feel this occur, it may be a good idea to stop what you’re doing and examine your hand. * The popping sensation isn’t always present when a knuckle is broken. Whether or not you’ll experience a popping feeling depends on the severity of your fracture. 2. Identify the cause of the injury. A broken knuckle is often referred to as a “boxer’s fracture” because it occurs most often when a person punches a hard surface. When your injury happened, were you punching a wall or some other immovable surface? Maybe you were involved in a fist fight. If you have been hitting something solid, there’s a good chance you may have broken your knuckle. * There are other possible ways to break your knuckle that are not as common. You can break your knuckle while falling down, working with machines or doing any activity that exposes your hand to trauma. * Some doctors now call a broken knuckle a “brawler’s fracture” instead of a “boxer’s fracture” because boxers prevent broken knuckles by wearing protective gear. You’re more likely to break a knuckle hitting something with your bare fist. 3. Feel immediate pain. A broken knuckle will be accompanied with severe, immediate pain. Right when the injury occurs, you will experience a sharp pang in your hand which will be followed by an intense throbbing feeling. Depending on your body’s tolerance for pain, the feeling can be debilitating and force you to stop whatever you’re doing. * If your knuckle only has a minor fracture, the pain may not be as severe.	.

Identify_Good_Sellers_and_Authentic_Items_on_eBay.txt	## Steps	Not all sellers from China can only sell poor , cheap and fake products .	## Steps	For example , not all sellers from China can only sell poor , cheap and fake products .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Not><1><not><4>	Steps  1. Item Title. I have never bought a title with Exaggerated Symbols(using a lot of @ $ % &) or letters(such as all capital letters). It seems that the product is very poor, if it's a brand item, It must be a fake for sure! It would be attracted me to take a tour on his/her store. Further More, some sellers indicate they are US seller on listing title. First, it's deceptive (just my opinion). their items my not good quality or fake, but just pretend to be a US seller since they are living in US or they are using oversea warehouse to deliver their items to US buyers. Second, most of Real US sellers don't do and won't do that. 2. Pictures. I never buy something with poor pictures due to it's an attitude problem. Can you imagine you are selling a premium items but using poor pictures to show how fabulous your items are? I believe Slow work yields fine products. In addition, I don't trust sellers who make up pictures excessively or add too many ornaments on pics. It makes items vulgar, and you intent to confuse consumers. I only trust sellers who list simple and clear pictures that incorporate the wisdom and detail to show nature and original items to customers. 3. Description. It may be the most important part to decide to buy a item or not. I have been seen a lot of sellers neglected Aesthetics of the font and page - cluttered composing, ugly fonts and messy page. How can you persuade me or prove you are selling high grade or authentic items? The internet brings us business at a low cost, however, how to display and demonstrate your products are competitive and better than others are a big problem due to customers can't touch and compare like a local store on ebay. Every trusted seller has a fabulous and great pages on ebay or their own sites. As a buyer, I trust them whose online stores seem to be professional. When shopping at some small stores on ebay or other sites (many small and not famous but good stuffs), I only choose them with a neat page, appropriate font size and clear, concise description. 4. At last, I have to say abandon the stereotype.	You are able to buy good quality, creative and originally designed products from them. Maybe not too many, BUT there are still some Chinese sellers stick to principles and try to make difference, such as me ^_^

Remove the insoles and laces from your Yeezys. Take special care to not damage the insoles when taking them out of the shoes. You should pull the laces slowly from the shoes so you don't cause wear and tear to the eyelets. * Place the insoles and laces to one side to protect them from damage while you clean the rest of the shoes. 2. Make a vinegar and water solution. Pour 1 part water and 2 parts white vinegar into a small cup and use a spoon to mix them together. Soak a clean cloth with the mixture and gently wipe the shoes with the cloth. * Then use a cloth dipped in water to wipe away the vinegar from the shoes. * Dry the shoes with a dry cloth after. * You can also use a specialized shoe cleaner instead of the water and vinegar solution. There are some shoe cleaners which work especially well with Yeezys such as the "Jason Markk Cleaner", "Crep Protect Cleaner." 3. Dip a hard-bristled brush in the mix and scrub the soles. The sole is easily the dirtiest part of any shoe so you might need to scrub especially hard to remove the dirt. Don't be afraid to be rigorous with the scrub, the soles are very durable. * Avoid the knitting and stitching with the brush. * You can use a cloth or rag if you don't have a hard-bristled brush. The cloth or rag might not be as effective though. * Dip your brush into the mixture frequently to ensure you aren't simply scrubbing the dirt into the sole of the shoe. 4. Use a damp cloth to wipe off the soles. After you've finished scrubbing the soles, soak a clean cloth in water and wipe the soles of your Yeezys. Wipe the sides as well to make sure they're as clean as they can be. * Don't forget to clean the Boost window when cleaning the soles of your Yeezys. The Boost window is a triangular shaped area on the sole of the shoes where dirt and dust can easily get trapped. 5. Scrub the main part of the shoe with a wet soft-bristled brush. You only need to dip the brush in water for this part of the process. Put your hand inside your Yeezy to anchor the shoe and provide support against the brushing.	Remember to frequently dip the brush to clean it.

Watch body language. Body language says a lot about a person, if he rarely ever looks at you, or isn't smiling (and has a vacant expression) while looking at you, odds are, he isn't into you. If he's interested, usually he will be looking at you a lot, and he will be willing to start small talk. 2. Pay attention to if he's ignoring you. If he ignores you during the day, and he shows hardly any interest, and looks at you once, then it's quite obvious he doesn't really find you interesting. 3. If he's talking to other girls, and not to you, it's just quite obvious that he's probably interested in one of them. It also may be a possibility he's trying to make you jealous, if your not sure, look at him, and if he's talking to the girls and glancing at you, that could be one of the signs he likes you and is trying to make you jealous. 4. When he's looking at you, look at his eyes; if his pupils get larger, then he likes you. This has been proven that if a human really likes something, their pupils will enlarge. 5. Drop something, anything, a book, a pencil, possibly right in front of him, if he is willing to help you, there is a good chance he likes you, especially if he starts conversation with you right after. Guys usually always help out girls they like.	.

Research a publication to know your potential audience. Every publication has a different angle they may wish to cover a story from. This angle is usually what draws readers to that particular publication. That may be true of both the political slant of that publication and the general subjects that are usually addressed by the editors and contributors. * Check the general angle of both the publication you're considering and its typical audience. You won't get a liberal-leaning piece published in a conservative newspaper, or vice versa, so know your audience before you submit anything. * If you read a publication regularly, you should be familiar with that publication's opinions and beliefs. If not, you can search online to find out which political candidates that publication has endorsed, what angle they cover stories from, etc. * Don't forget that you'll need to write for a general audience. That means using easily-understood (but not poorly-written) language without any technical terms or jargon. 2. Decide whether to pitch the idea or submit it unsolicited. Some writers will email an editor at the start of the day and pitch their idea for an opinion piece. Editors often say no, but if an editor finds the idea interesting he or she is almost certainly going to publish what you submit. However, you don't necessarily need to pitch anything. Most opinion pieces are submitted without any type of query or pitch, and the editor will decide upon reading it whether to publish it or not. 3. Write a byline and cover letter. Whether you pitch your idea or submit it blindly, you'll need to compose a short bio (called a byline in print media) in which you describe yourself and your credentials in the third person. You should also write a professional cover letter that is addressed to the editor of that specific publication. Your cover letter doesn't need to be long, but it should describe your attached piece, explain why you think it should be published, and thank the editor for his or her time. * A byline might read something like, "John Doe is an environmental activist working for _____. He's working closely with the EPA on the ongoing excavation and visits the site on a daily basis to conduct soil tests in the region." 4. Submit your piece and follow up with the editor. Once you've written your piece and the accompanying byline and cover letter, you're ready to submit it to a publication. Some editors say that if you don't hear a response within 48 hours there's a good chance your piece isn't being picked up, but sometimes submissions get held up for various reasons. * Sometimes there are technical errors that prevent the editor from getting your submission, which you wouldn't know about without following up. * Other times the editor may like the piece and decide to wait for a better issue to include it in.	.

Read a book that helps them overcome childhood fears. Read to your child nightly to help soothe them to sleep. Allow them to select a book of their choosing or consider purchasing books addressing fears of monsters. A list of these books include: * The Monster at the End of this Book * Can’t You Sleep, Little Bear? * The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark * What a Bad Dream 2. Schedule time hours before bed to discuss worries. Do some fact checking about their monsters with them earlier in the day rather than later. Rather than always waiting until right before bed to address your child’s concerns, begin talking about them after school or dinner. This will ensure that their worries are being addressed early on, which will help make their transition to sleep easier and faster. 3. Help them shift their nighttime thoughts. Make a list with your child of different things they are looking forward to, or a list of their general interests. Have them cycle through this list every night so that they have things to think of rather than the monsters. * This is a great way to shift their focus at night to something more positive and constructive. 4.

Understand what a real estate investment group (REIG) is. Like a REIT, a real estate investment group pools the money of two or more people to purchase, develop, manage and sell properties. In many cases, the properties bought are apartments or a similar property type, and each individual investor owns individual units within the building. * Because these groups are generally much smaller than real estate investment trusts, members can aid in managing properties and gather tips and advice from other seasoned investors. * In some cases, the company that manages the REIG will do all of the advertising, management, and maintenance for investors. This allows investors to make money without any additional effort. 2. Research REIGs. REIGs function much like mutual funds, and also have the fees that go with them. Be sure to investigate any potential REIG investment before committing your money to determine that their fee structure is fair. Also, look for indications of past success (or failure) that might allow you to determine whether or not the REIG is a safe investment. 3. Invest money in REIGs.	To invest, search for real estate investment groups in your area and contact them for more information.

Invest_in_Real_Estate_when_You_Have_a_Tight_Budget.txt	## Steps	Investing in wrong realty project may lead to future losses .	## Steps	Because investing in wrong realty project may lead to future losses .	<insert><Because><1>|||<replace><Investing><1><investing><2>	Steps  1. Look for unfurnished homes. Investing in low cost property includes purchasing houses that are unfurnished. * Most houses that seem expensive come with furniture. They are expensive because of the investment done on the interiors and decor. So, avoid such apartments. * Buying an empty house will also allow you to design it the way you want, which in turn adds value to the house. This will let you decorate the rooms, within your budget and at the pace you want. 2. Tweak your spending habits. Even if you’ve got a lot of money at your disposal, making a profitable real estate investment is expensive. You may need to make some sacrifices to purchase the property you’re looking for, especially if you’re on a tight budget.  * Save on transportation. Consider carpooling or travelling through public transport. * If you have debts, you can save on them too. Refinance your house or automobile. You can also consider selling unused items and signing up for automatic debt payment plans. * Cut down expenses on luxury services and products, and opt for substitutes that are comparatively cheaper. It will help you with your savings in the long-run. 3. Engage in crowdfunding. This is a new form of investment where a number of property owners and investors come together online to invest in property. The advantage is that you can put any amount of money into the investment. However, this has caused many scams due to its informal nature. Some banks are making it mandatory to register yourself in case you seek crowdfunding. 4. Try real estate stocks. Instead of directly investing in a plot or a flat, you can invest in stocks of a real estate company. * Investing in real estate stocks will leave you with liquid funds, and you have the opportunity to exit in case the company faces a downturn. * Make sure you pick companies that provide a good dividend. If you’re afraid, you might choose the wrong company. Remember, pick a mutual fund that invests in real estate companies. 5. Check out group investments. You can find nine to ten other people with low budgets; pool together your resources to buy new and emerging properties. * Be sure to pick properties that have hope for good appreciation in the future.	.

Recognize common causes of trauma. Autistic people can be traumatized by the same things that cause trauma in non-autistics. Consider whether your loved one has experienced severe stressors such as... * Natural disasters * Abuse (emotional, physical, sexual) and neglect; witnessing others being abused * War * Injury or life-changing health problem * Death * End of an important relationship * Sexual assault * Trauma in the family (e.g. a boy traumatized by watching his father's trauma) * Prolonged or extreme bullying 2. Keep an eye out for bullying. A cumulation of bullying incidents over time can lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in victims. (This includes teasing, violence, rumors, exclusion, and cyberbullying.) Autistic people are at high risk for bullying, and this may lead to trauma. 3. Consider how the autistic person is treated in therapy.	.

Determine your strengths. Since you will have to do some research when it comes to which company to invest in, focus at first on companies that you have some working knowledge of. This will make things a little more interesting and engaging as you get started. * Check local companies as you may have more of an opportunity to engage them and get a feel for how their business affects your area. 2. Consider the overall value of a stock. You'll need to do some research and math to determine the value of a company. You'll soon see that $1 stock is not necessarily cheaper than a $40 one. A stock with a value higher than the listed price is one that's probably worth buying. * Since buying stock means you're buying part-ownership of the company, determine if it would make financial sense to buy the entire company. * Find out how long it would take to pay off your investment from profits if you bought the entire company. Use the results to determine if it is worthwhile to invest in shares. * Keep in mind that profits can change wildly as markets change. Technologies can become obsolete, or regulations could change that render a company's products useless. * To determine the value of a company you will have to look at several variables. These include Future Performance, Cash Flow, and Revenue, among many others. * Future Performance. A company's worth is based largely on projections of future performance. Past performance is important only for modeling how the company will perform in the future. * Cash Flow. In general, a company that has a lot of assets and high operating costs has less cash flow than a similar business with less assets and a lower operating cost. Cash flow is cash on hand that can be used to pay debt. * Revenue. Revenue is one of the major factors when valuing a company. If two companies have the same cash flow, but one has a higher revenue, that company will most likely be worth more. 3. Create a diverse portfolio. While it is important to invest in what you know, you don't want all your eggs in one basket. If something happens to the industry that you are invested in, you could lose most of your investment in one swoop. Invest broadly to minimize risk of sudden loss. * Invest in a broad range of markets. If you are heavily focused in technology, consider investing in consumer goods and real estate. * Most investment experts recommend not putting all of your investment into the stock market.	.

Make a stronger bond: Make sure the people you consider your friends are really your friends.True friends will readily accept you for what you are.However if you consider to be a true friend to someone and wish they should accept you for what you are,build a stronger bond.Your frienship cannot survive over mere pretty silk threads of style and charisma;They should be anchors of care ,attitude and acceptance. 5. Respect yourself: It is a very common fact that people respect you only when you respect yourself.You should not subside to others' demand and wishes.It like flow of water down a slope ,Once you bow,you have to lie down straight to stop. 6. Speak out: You must speak out all your thoughts to your friends.You must be able to make them understand that you are happy with what you are and do not need any counselling from them. They may never know how you feel until you tell them;Maybe they think they are helping. Afterall they are your friends and they will understand. 7. Let go: If they continue enlightening you even after you tell them it is not welcome, its time you understand they are not your true friends and let go.	.

Know that you create your own self fulfilling prophesies about your kid. * Whatever you believe about your child, they WILL become. * If you believe that your child is a little angel, then they will probably most of the time be a little angle.

Remember that they are small, and they are not capable of nearly as much as you are. * If you are too harsh with them, they will only hate you. Maybe they won't when they are little, but watch out for the teenage years. We reap what we sow, and if you sow criticism and anger, you will reap criticism and anger. 5. Show interest in their life. * Show interest in what they are doing, in their hobbies, in their friends. * You may be able to keep them out of a lot of trouble if you would just communicate with them about their life more often. * They won't care what you know, until they know that you care. So show that you care, and then they will be more open to you giving them advice. 6. Remember that any kindness you show to your child now, will be given back to you when you are older. * Often times parents who just throw their kids in child care, later in life, get thrown in an old folks home by those kids. * However you want them to treat you when you are old, treat them that way now when they are young. 7. Disregard any negative report from others about your child. * Don't let people gossip to you about them.	.

Keep quiet. If you are with someone who is grieving and don't know what to say, then don't say anything. Don't feel obliged to speak, as you may very well accomplish exactly the opposite of what you intend by saying something stupid. Sitting there in silence may feel very awkward to you, but some of the greatest help you can offer is simply to sit next to your friend, put your arm around their shoulder, and let them cry in silence. Your presence next to that person says the one thing that is most needed in those moments, and says it more eloquently than you ever could in words. It says, "I love you, and you are not alone!" 2. Allow the bereaved to say anything...or nothing. At various points in the process, your friend will likely want to scream at someone. Who that "someone" will be changes from moment to moment. They may want to yell at God for not keeping the suicide from happening, at the deceased loved one for not calling for help, at anyone and everyone who had ever failed the deceased, including themselves. They may want to say things that are absolutely crazy. In those moments, it is essential for them to have friends and family who will allow them to say these things without judgement, advice or correction. If the person who is grieving says something hurtful or incorrect or just plain stupid, don't use it as an opportunity to show off your counselling skills. A simple statement such as this will be much more helpful: "I love you. I know you are hurting beyond what I could ever understand; but know that I'm here for you any time you need me, for as long as you need me. And, I truly believe you are going to get through this." The person probably knows that what they are saying is irrational (and is likely feeling guilty about it), so unconditional acceptance and love in those moments is powerful. 3. Keep your phone on. A person who has lost someone to suicide will very likely find that their sleep has been stolen from them. They will wake up in the middle of the night - if they were lucky enough to fall asleep in the first place - and the loneliness and sorrow will sometimes be overwhelming. Especially during the first few weeks, it is essential that the person has someone to call any time, day or night. They may feel awkward or say they won't do it, but they may very well find themselves needing a listening ear at three in the morning, and you can graciously sit and talk to them for as long as they need you. Physical darkness can enhance the darkness someone feels inside; having someone to talk them through the night can help a grief-stricken survivor get through until the sunrise reminds them there is still hope. 4. Do things that show you are thinking rather than just reacting. When there is a death, social custom causes the bereaved to be drowned in flowers, calls of sympathy, and letters in the mail. These things are essential and appreciated. However, with all the emotional trauma being dealt with, most of those things will be just a blur to the person. Months later, they probably could not tell you who specifically sent a card or flowers or called in the days immediately after the suicide. What they will remember, though, is the friend who does something that shows real thoughtfulness beyond social duty. These will be specific to each individual circumstance, but the tips section below gives some examples of things that helped a survivor in one particular circumstance. 5. Remember the difficult dates. From the day of the suicide until the wake, funeral, and burial are complete (i.e. - the first week or two), the survivor will be surrounded by well-wishers. However, that crowd quickly dissipates after the "official" social processes have been completed, leaving the griever alone long before the pain has gone away. One way you can remind that person that they are not alone is by remembering the tough dates. The "month-markers" are the first that come to mind in a suicide. If the loved on died on the 10th of October, your friend will undoubtedly face particularly-difficult days on the 10 of November, the 10th of December, the 10th of January, and so forth. The first 6 months to a year are especially rough to get through (perhaps longer for some), and a call or a note on those month marks will do more than you can imagine to communicate to the person that you truly care. Other dates that are difficult include the deceased person's birthday, any special days they shared (for example, if it's a partner or spouse that has passed away, the date of their anniversary or first date), and special holidays, particularly religious ones. The greater the joy previously associated with a date, the greater potential for sorrow now. 6. Know that you don't have to be a superhero.	Keeping these suggestions in mind will set you miles apart from many who will be kind, but not really infuse hope to a person who probably feels like there is no reason even to look to the future.

Pinch away faded blooms. When the roses are blooming, remove the faded blossoms to encourage more flowers to grow. This process is called ‘deadheading’. Make sure to dispose of the dead heads in the compost pile, rather than leaving them on the ground. 2. Prune your roses at least once a year. All roses require some pruning in late fall, winter or very early spring. Use sharp hand pruners with a scissor action to prune your roses. * Dull and anvil-type pruners will crush the rose stem, causing serious damage to the bush. 3. Cut the stems at a 45-degree angle just beyond a growth bud. Growth buds on rose stems are usually located where a leaf with five leaflets is growing. The new stem will grow from the growth bud just below the pruning cut. 4. Know how much of each rose to prune away. The amount of the rose that should be pruned off depends on the type of rose.	.

Use wire or thread for the base of the necklace. Wire and thread are the best options for making a beaded necklace. Make sure that you can fit the beads onto the thread or wire. * Thread, such as nylon fishing line, stretchy thread, or a durable polyester or cotton thread in the color of your choice. This is the best option for beaded necklaces. * Wire made from copper, aluminum, or stainless steel is also a good base for stringing beads. Some types of wire are also color-coated, so you can get them in the color of your choice. 2. Cut the wire or thread longer than your necklace length. Cutting the wire or thread longer than you want the finished necklace to be will ensure that you have plenty of material to work with. Otherwise, it may be hard to secure the ends. Some common necklace lengths include: * , also known as choker length * , right on the collarbone * , just below the collar bone * , in the center of the chest * , between the breasts * , between the breasts * , right at the top of the abdomen * , just above the belly button * , right at the belly button or just below it 3. Choose beads that will complement your necklace base. You can use any type of beads you want to create your necklace. Purchase beads in the jewelry supply section of a craft supply store or online. Make sure that you can fit the necklace base material through the openings on your beads. * Use seed beads as filler or for a delicate beaded necklace. Seed beads are small beads that will fill out the wire or thread. These are great for creating a delicate necklace or for filling the spaces in between your larger beads. * Choose chunky beads for a statement necklace. Chunky beads work well as a complement to smaller beads, or as the main element in a chunky statement necklace. Wire or fishing line works best as a base for chunky beads since they are heavier than normal beads. 4. Tie the end of your necklace base around 1 end of your clasp (optional). A clasp is option for a beaded necklace. If it is large enough, then you can simple tie the ends together when you are finished.	Insert the end of the wire or thread through the end of the clasp and tie it in a knot. This will prevent the beads from slipping off as you string them and then you will also have the first half of the clasp in place.
Lower_High_Blood_Pressure_Without_Using_Medication.txt	## Steps	Even one or two cups of coffee can raise blood pressure into the unhealthy Stage 1 level .	## Steps	But , even one or two cups of coffee can raise blood pressure into the unhealthy Stage 1 level .	<insert><But><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Even><1><even><3>	Steps  1. Avoid table salt (sodium, sodium chloride, NaCl). Sodium causes you to retain fluids, which makes your blood have more fluid volume. When your blood has more volume, your heart has to pump harder to move that excess volume throughout the body. This causes the blood pressure to go up. Remember, it's not just the salt that you put on your food while cooking or at the table, it's also the amount of sodium that's in the prepared foods that you buy. You should become "label conscious" and buy "low salt/sodium" or "unsalted" foods. Avoid preserved foods, canned and bottled foods (such as meats, pickles, soups, chili and such), bacon, ham, sausage, bakery products and MSG (mono-sodium glutamate), meats with added water have higher sodium content, also prepared mustard, salsa, ketchup, Bar-Be-Que and other sauces. Many American diets include up to 5,000 milligrams of sodium daily which nearly all medical professionals consider extremely unhealthy. Medical professionals often prescribe LOW sodium diets that consist of between 1100 and 1500 milligrams daily. The American Heart Association advises that the human body actually can function with as little as only 200mg of sodium daily. If one can't live without a "salty" flavor, there are multiple brands of seasonings that amount to herbs or fake salt products on the market. Not just low or "lite" salt products but salt substitutes (potassium based for example). 2. Eat a moderate, lean diet and avoid stimulants. Avoid caffeine, white carbs (although pastas are not as quick to form sugar as breads, pastries and cakes are), candy, sugary drinks and excessive dietary fats. Try eating a more plant based diet, instead of so much of meats, milk and eggs.	If a person already has Stage 1 Hypertension, coffee usually complicates the problem even further. Caffeine is a stimulant. This causes the heart to beat faster. When the heart beats faster, the blood pressure raises. If you are a person who drinks a lot of caffeine (more than 4 caffeinated drinks/day), you may need to taper yourself off of the caffeine to prevent withdrawal symptoms such as headaches.

Choose your theme. Themes make your treasure hunt fun especially if you choose a theme based on the interests of your kids. For example, if your son likes pirates you can make a pirate treasure hunt. * Other possible themes are: Disney princesses, dinosaurs, ancient Egypt, jungle, Indiana Jones, carnival, camping, fairies, mystery, current events, tv shows, videogames, etc. 2. Plan your clues. Find clues online or brainstorm clues based on how old and savvy the kids playing will be. The players need the clues to get from one spot to the next. Older players need more challenging clues like riddles while younger players need fun clues like rhymes. If there are very young players, you can just use pictures as clues. * Choose the number of clues according to how much time you have and how many players are participating. Try to make the clues stick to the theme of your treasure hunt. If you are making a dinosaur treasure hunt, relate each clue to a different dinosaur. * An example of a riddle is, “I have a face that never frowns, hands that do not wave, no mouth but a familiar sound. I can’t walk but I move around.” * An example of clue sequence would be: Clue 1: When your hunger strikes you mood, it leads you here to get some food. (Place Clue 2 found in the pantry.) Clue 2: Hooray, you’ve made it to number two. To get to number three, put these on before your shoe. (Place Clue 3 in the sock drawer) 3. Plan your treasure. Choose a variety of prizes that relate to the theme of your treasure hunt. There may be players with food allergies so be sure to ask if you’re including snacks or treats. Plan the treasure in private so no players can cheat. You may use an old container, decorate it, and fill it with toys and treats from the dollar store. * Prizes can include candy, pencils, toys, coins, light-up necklaces, and glow sticks. If you design your own box you, can ask your kids and other players to help you decorate it. You may also skip using a single treasure chest and use individual goody bags. Simply decorate brown paper bags and fill each with prizes. 4. Hide your clues. Make sure that the players cannot see you as you place the clues around the house or outside if weather permits. Make sure you keep the clues accessible if you have small children playing. Place the clues far apart and in locations that aren’t similar. You don’t want a player finding the wrong clue. * You can get the kids to eat a snack or plant the clues while the kids are at school. Make sure that they are always supervised so you don’t risk having someone wander over to sneak a peek at you while you are hiding the clues. 5. Send them on their treasure hunt. Gather the players and explain the rules. Make sure they know what’s out of bounds, you don’t want them wandering into a dangerous room or outside if they aren’t allowed. Split a larger group into teams and make sure there’s an equal amount of skill in each team.	.

Get a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment, plenty of vacuum bags, cleaning rags or paper towels, window cleaner, furniture polish, air fresheners or fragranced candles, feather duster, etc. * Limit your purchases to replace something rather than to buy more of the same. The more you have, the more storage area you'll need as well. * Most discount stores and thrift stores have great storage options at an affordable price. * Use your computer for budgeting, paying bills, books, movies, music and other media. Eliminate other devices and appliances. * Use minimal window treatments. A small valance and mini blinds are sufficient and fashionable. Drapes are more expensive and difficult to clean. Blinds are more adjustable than a pull shade. * Choose rugs that are easy to clean. A throw rug can be tossed in the washing machine where a larger rug requires vacuuming and shampooing.	.

Place slices of stale or fresh bread directly onto an oven shelf. Use as many slices as you'd like, but you won't fit a whole loaf in most ovens! 3. Heat until the slices turn dry and crisp. Remove from the oven using oven mitts. Don't allow them to brown––about 7 to 10 minutes should be enough but keep an eye on them, as every oven behaves differently. 4. Crush the dry bread slices. This can be done easily using a food processor or a blender. Simply add in small batches, process or blend, then remove the smooth crumbs to the storage container and repeat until all bread slices have been crumbled. * You can also crush the slices manually using a rolling pin on a chopping board.

Make sure it's secure so there's no chance it will fall. The bottle must be easily accessible to your hamster. 3. Add bedding to the bottom of the cage. This can be aspen or paper shavings. Any softwood bedding (pine and cedar) is harmful to a hamster, and the fumes can cause respiratory problems Wood chip bedding should only be used in very temporary settings. Also be sure not to use cotton bedding as it can get tangled around their limbs and injure them. 4. Make a little house for him out of a cardboard box and put bedding inside.	.

Choose a layered look. Since long, straight hair has the same effect as wearing monochromatic colors and vertical stripes—making you look taller—you should choose a look that is layered. Getting a haircut with many long and short layers will distract people from how tall you are. * Many waves in your hair can also achieve this effect. * If you have natural waves, use a gel to capture them. * If you have naturally straight hair, use a curling iron, overnight curlers, or hot rollers. You can even use a hair dryer over a rounded brush to create waves. 2. Create layers without cutting your hair. If you have long, straight hair that you don’t want to cut, you may want to try putting it up in different ways to create the illusion of layers. You can accomplish this by pulling back only the top layer of hair or pinning up different areas of hair. * You can also try braiding techniques that make your hair look layered. 3. Avoid lots of volume. Avoid hairstyles that add inches to your height, like pompadours and styles with a lot of volume.	By the same token, avoid messy buns on top of your head.

Wear skirts and dresses that reach the ankle if you’re a lady. Modesty is key when trying to dress like a Victorian. Unless women were attending a ball, they were expected to keep their arms and legs covered (to the wrists and to the ankles). Corsets and petticoats were used underneath gowns to help them keep their shape. * For fancy events, like balls and weddings, women could wear a low-cut dress with short sleeves, though they must wear long gloves to keep their arms covered. * Appropriate accessories for women are: gloves, hats, fans, parasols, and brooches. 2. Don stovepipe pants and jackets if you are a gentleman. The style for men was characterized by clean, basic lines, dark colors, and fine details. Men would often wear a coat, a vest, an undershirt, stovepipe pants, and a hat on any regular day. * Accessories for men include: ties, pocket watches, walking sticks, and gloves. 3. Rethink your beauty routine.	Ditch the makeup routine in the morning. Use era-appropriate soaps for washing your hair and body. Take baths rather than showers. Modern conveniences like hairdryers, curlers, straighteners, gels, sprays, makeup, deodorants, body washes, and nail polishes weren’t around in the Victorian era. (And showers didn’t yet exist.)

Assemble the blender properly and secure all the parts each time you use it. In most cases, an incorrectly assembled blender just won't work or won't work well, but sometimes, loose parts could fly out or you could damage the blender. 2. Blend only appropriate items. Despite the popularity of the "Will it Blend" series, you're best off using your blender for its intended use. If you do use a blender for making paper or some other non-food purpose, use a separate, inexpensive blender that you won't mind losing. 3. Cut up larger pieces of food. You can leave things in fairly large chunks, but make sure they are at least small enough to fit into the bottom part of your blender. Smaller chunks will blend easiest and handle the best. 4. Blend a little at a time. If you're not getting good results, pour out some of what you're blending into a separate bowl or other container, and only blend a little bit at a time. Blending too much is similar to trying to chew with too much in your mouth. 5. Use ample moisture. Add plenty of liquid to the mix that you're blending. A mixture that is too dry will behave like a paste and push up away from the blades. This is not necessarily harmful, but it's not too effective, either. Depending on what foods you're blending, you may add different liquids: water, milk, fruit juice, soup stock, and so on. 6. Choose a suitable speed and setting for what you are blending. Most blenders also have continuous and intermittent (pulse) modes. 7. Clean your blender after each use. Some blenders are self cleaning but if not, simply remove the vessel from the base pour water and soap or vinegar into the vessel and run it on "pulse" for a few moments. The base of the blender is an electrical device. Under no circumstances should water be placed in this assembly, and it should never be submerged in water. See warnings, below. 8. Unscrew the blade assembly and thoroughly clean the blender. You don't have to do this every time you use the blender, just every few times. 9. Wipe with a soft cloth after cleaning, taking care not to touch the blades. Make sure the blender has ample time to dry, and reassemble the blender with the rubber gasket or seal on the correct side of the blade assembly. 10. Troubleshoot specific problems with your blender. * Replace worn, bent, or dulled blades. They can't generally be sharpened. * Replace a broken or cracked pitcher. Most manufacturers offer replacements for sale. *	Otherwise, service the speed control switch or have it serviced.

Draw a center line on the sock from the toe to approximately one inch from the colored heel. This will become the split in the monkey’s legs. Again, note that the heel is actually hidden beneath the sock at this point, so you may have to flip it over briefly to double-check your positioning.  3. With the sock still folded flat, sew up one side of your marked line and back down the other. Leave approximately 1/4 inch (64 mm) between the line and each of your seams. You can either use a sewing machine or sew by hand. up one side of the line and back down the other.]] 4. Cut along the line between your two seams. The monkey’s legs and colored feet will now be clearly visible.  5. Turn the sock right-side out and stuff the entire thing. The upper half of the sock will become the torso and head.  6. Sew the head and/or hat. If your sock opening is the same color as the body of the sock, just make a nice rounded head and stitch it shut. If it is a contrasting color, you will need to decide if you want to cut it off (making a shorter body for the monkey) and make the head as usual or use the excess coloring as a "hat" by not stuffing the last inch or two and cinching the opening into a cone shape. * To make the head: * Stitch around the neck with quarter inch stitches. Use sturdy thread such as embroidery floss. * Pull the stitches snugly until you get the size neck you want and knot the ends. * Round out the head area with stuffing as desired and stitch the top opening shut. * To make the hat: * Gather the tip with large stitches and snug/cinch them closed. * Fold the raw edges to the center and tuck inside. *	.

Find Yourself a Good Guide - What better place to learn the art of Thai cooking than in Thailand itself. Thailand and in particular Bangkok is the hub for Thai cooking schools. You get it all here; long elaborate cooking courses, to short concise daily classes that will help you get started with the basics. In fact, several luxury hotels Bangkok has provides their very own short cooking courses much to the delight of the keen learner. The Anantara Bangkok Sathorn is one fine example of such a hotel. If you are unable to get a tutor you can also opt to purchase some good videos and books that will help you - albeit not as perfectly - to incorporate the basics.Enter one step here and then click "Add Step" 2. Always select the best ingredients - Nothing beats the flavor and quality of fresh ingredients. To master the art of Thai cooking fresh ingredients are an absolute must. Especially when it comes to the flavoring, the dried and packed version is nothing compared to the sheer aroma of the fresh version. If you are not able to find fresh herbs such as galangal, pandan, or kaffir lime you can opt for the frozen version of these; the flavor is nearly as good. 3. Make Sure you have the Right Equipment - When it comes to Thai cooking, there are not a lot of Utensils and tools required. However, whatever is required is absolutely vital. The wok is the most important piece of utensil in Thai cuisine. Becoming a professional with Thai cooking techniques means learning to articulately handle a wok. Wooden spoons or shovels are used in the Wok to stir fry the ingredients. Thai ingredients also require a lot of pounding to make flavors readily available for incorporation. A mortar and a pestle especially made from stone or pottery is the best tool to crush and pound ingredients. Although food processors are a good modern substitute, the flavors are not quite as perfectly brought out like using a mortar and pestle. The Mortar and Pestle helps to crush cardamom pods, cumin pods and coriander, it is also an excellent tool to soften and beautifully bring out the fragrance of lemon grass.	.

Spend a lot of time together. It's natural to develop feelings for someone if you spend a lot of your time with that person. If you want your guy friend to develop romantic feelings for you, work on spending as much time together as possible. This can eventually lead to him developing romantic feelings. * Try to frequent the same places he does. If you know he hangs out at a local coffee shop, spend time there. Invite him out with your friends for group get togethers. Go to social events where you know you'll see him. * If you go to school together, try to interact with him frequently at school. Talk to him between classes. Sit by him in class whenever possible. Have lunch with him. 2. Emphasize your similarities. People want to date those who are similar to them. If you have a lot in common, play up these similarities. Do things to make him notice how alike the two of you are and he'll be more likely to see you as a potential love match. * Remember, you can't pretend to be someone you're not. Do not pretend to like something you don't just to get a guy. However, work on talking to him about mutual interests. If you both like a particular director, talk about movies by this director. * It can help to try to get into some of his interests, if you're genuinely intrigued by them. Listen to a band he likes, for example, and let him know if you enjoy the music as well. * You can also try to find common ground when it comes to differing interests. If he's a fan of horror movies, while you prefer comedies, you can play up the fact you both love film. 3. Try to spend time alone with him. This can help you transition the relationship from friendship to more. Work on having one-on-one time with him, as this will give you a chance to get a little flirty in order to gain his attention. Try to find times where the two of you can hang out alone. * If you're nervous, you can always go to a big social event and spend some time alone with him. For example, ask him to a party and then find a cozy corner where the two of you can chat. * You can also try to hang out one-on-one in casual settings. You can both, for example, grab a cup of coffee together after school. You don't have to make it a date yet if you're still trying to win his attention. 4. Initiate touch whenever possible. Touching someone releases certain chemicals in the brain that spur feelings of romantic attraction. If you're having trouble getting a guy to notice you, try touching him whenever possible. This can help him think of you in a more romantic sense. *	Lean into him a little while you're watching a movie.
Make_Jam.txt	## Steps	Cover the canner and bring the water to a gentle boil .	### Storing the Jam	Then , cover the canner and bring the water to a gentle boil .	<insert><Then><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Cover><1><cover><3>	Steps  1. Obtain a package of pectin and read the package insert for quantities. Pectin suppliers are the best source of information on exactly what works with their quantities and formulations. Read, then obtain the rest of your ingredients. * Pectin is a substance naturally present in apples and other fruit. It is what makes the jam or jelly gel and gives it its consistency. * Look for pectin in most supermarkets and large discount stores; it should be near the canning and baking aisles. * Pectin may be purchased as a liquid or a powder. Both forms work. 2. Gather and arrange your supplies. While the process is straightforward, it can be a bit rushed once you get started. You may have time to grab something out of a drawer, but not to wash the dishes or go out to the store for something you forgot. 3. Wash your hands thoroughly and keep them clean throughout the process. Wash them again before resuming work if you sneeze, visit the bathroom, or handle non-food items during the process. 4. Sterilize a dozen mason jars by boiling them in water for 10 minutes. If you are at high altitude, add an additional minute for each 1000 feet above sea level. Then, place them upside-down on a clean towel and drape another towel over them until you are ready to use them. You may not need all 12 jars, especially if you are using larger jars, like pints, but it is much easier to prepare too many than too few. * Why all this emphasis on cleanliness? The basic principle of canning is to kill all the microorganisms that spoil food, then to seal the jar tight to keep them out. 5. Wash the fruit under running water. Rub gently to remove any dirt or debris. 6. Prepare the fruit. Peel it, remove pits, stems, etc. Also, cut out any bad parts and discard any fruits that are overripe, bruised, or mouldy. Cut the fruit up a little if it is larger. 7. Crush the fruit with a potato masher or wooden spoon. Measure the crushed fruit, not the whole fruit. 8. For jelly, you may either purchase juice or strain your own. You may even wish to combine purchased and homemade juice. Store-bought cranberry juice is an excellent addition to apple jelly, for instance. * To strain your own juice, begin with peels from apples or peaches or cut-up fruit. * Place them into a large stock pot with just enough water to cover, and boil them until soft. Allow to cool. * Strain the mixture through a ricer to separate the pulp and juice from seeds, peels, and other solids. * Pour this pulp through a jelly bag or cheesecloth, allowing just the liquid to drip out. Leave plenty of time for it to drip. * Let this juice sit in a pot or jar in the refrigerator overnight to allow sediment to settle. When measuring, pour or spoon just the clear liquid off the top, leaving any cloudy sediment behind at the bottom. 9. Exactly measure the correct amount of fruit or juice for your recipe. You can add a small amount of fruit juice or water to take up any differences, but it's best to use pure fruit, if possible. 10. Exactly measure the correct amount of sugar for your recipe. Do not add it yet, but do have it ready to add quickly later. 11. Place the fruit in a stock pot or large saucepan. Add any lemon juice, the pectin and the butter or margarine. Stir them in. If you are using an electric stove, it is a good idea to place a wire heat diffuser between the burner and the pot. It will help to prevent scorching. 12. Turn on the stove and, stirring constantly, bring the fruit mixture to a full, rolling boil. A full, rolling boil is one where the bubbles do not stop or lessen when you stir it. * Stir constantly and all the way to the bottom to avoid burning the fruit. 13. Pour in the sugar, with the heat still on, and stir it in until it dissolves completely. You will notice that the fruit becomes clearer and brighter when you add the sugar. Continue stirring constantly. 14. Bring the mixture back to a full, rolling boil and boil for the time stated by the pectin package, in this case four minutes. Continue stirring constantly. 15. At the end of the time, turn off the heat and remove the pot from the burner. 16. Use a spoon to skim any foam or bubbles off the top surface. It will be whitish, and some batches will have more than others. You don't have to get every speck, but if you leave it in the jam, it will change the consistency and not taste very good. * The jam is hot and sticky. Skim carefully and have a small bowl nearby in which to discard the foam. 17. Quickly ladle the jam or jelly into the prepared jars. Use a canning funnel to guide the jam into the jar. * Leave 1/8 inch of empty space, or "head space", at the top. 18. Wipe the rims and threads of the jars with a clean, damp cloth to remove any residue or drips. Make especially sure to clean the top surface where the seal will seat. 19. Boil about an inch of water in the bottom of a medium saucepan and remove it from the heat. Place the seals into the water. Push them down so that they sink, and try not to stack them on each other, so that they heat evenly. Allow them to soften for a minute or two. You can do this step while you ladle and wipe rims, if you time it right. 20. Place a softened seal on each jar. A magnetic lid wand will help you get them safely out of the boiling water. To release the seal, set it on a jar and tilt the wand. If you don't have a lid wand, you can use a small pair of tongs. 21. Screw a clean ring down over the seal and tighten it with snug hand pressure. Don't tighten so much that you press all the seal material off of the rim. 22. Lower the jars onto a rack in a water-bath canner or large stock pot. If you use a large stock pot, place a rack or other spacer on the bottom so that the jars do not rest directly on the bottom of the pot. Add enough hot water to cover them by 1-2 inches. You can measure it to the first knuckle, as shown. 23.	Boil for 10 minutes, adding 5 minutes to the processing time for each 3000-foot increase in altitude.

Clean up your digital footprint. Your digital footprint is comprised of the information about you that is on the internet. Before the background check you should take some steps to learn what is out there and make any necessary changes. * Google yourself. If your search turns up information that you don’t want out there, ask the site administrator to take it down. If it’s a post by a friend, ask them to remove it. * Update your privacy settings by taking a look at all of your social media accounts and ensuring that you have the strictest settings applied. * Don’t post things that you wouldn’t want a potential employer to see. 2. Verify your professional licenses and certificates. If your profession requires you to hold a license, check with the issuing agency to make sure that your records match theirs. This process will vary depending on which country you live in, and in the U.S., by state to state. You can typically go to your state’s .gov website to get started. * For example, if you live in Indiana, you would go to in.gov and click on the tab that says “License”. * You can then see your options for requesting and viewing licenses. 3. Update your reference information. If you choose to list references on your resume, make sure that you provide up to date phone numbers and email addresses. You should also have this information handy when filling out job applications. You don’t want to provide an out of date phone number and leave the prospective employer with a lack of information. * It is considered good form to give people a heads up if you are using them as a reference. 4. Dispel myths about what will appear on a background check.	Your credit report and court records will not reveal your affiliation. However, a potential employer might be able to find that information about you on social media.

You gauge your measure of success by how much you accomplish. You even determine how happy you allow yourself to be by how much you’ve gotten done in the day. When this occurs, work turns into a chore. You don’t enjoy the work, you just to do it so it can be over with. Then you can feel good, right? But wait, there’s that thing you forgot about. You still need to do that. And oh yeah, there’s that other thing you haven’t done yet.

Realize that doctors are trying to sell happiness through pills. If you are depressed and you tell any doctor or psychologist about it what will they tell you? "Here take these pills. They will fix your problem?" But will they really? * What is the unspoken expectation about the pills? That they will make you happy and that they will, or might, make your life perfect. But to believe that would be to live in a fantasy. 2. Marx had the same dream of a utopia when he invented Communism. He literally thought that he would be the Robin Hood and the savior of the world by creating Communism. * Marx believed that stealing from the rich and giving to the poor would create a perfect society where everybody would be happy. But did that happen? No, obviously not. He was just another man living in a fantasy. 3. Christians, or any person of faith, tries to sell that religious faith will make your life perfect. Some Christians try to say that getting the extra "Baptism of the Holy Spirit" will make your life perfect. * But the fact is life sucks for every single human being alive, religious or not. * You may experience a high off of either a new faith or this extra dose of the Holy Spirit for a time, but as with everything, the newness fades away with time and you are again left with the mediocrity and difficulties of life to deal with. 4. For a person's entire life in school, the education system tries to sell you that good grades and more degrees will make your life perfect. It's easy to think that if you had a PhD, then your life would definitely be perfect. But that is yet another fantasy lie from Satan. * More degrees, a PhD, perfect grades etc. will not make you as happy as you think it will. * Many people reach their graduation day for a degree thinking it will be a big high of some sort, but it isn't. It is just like any other day and it really isn't that special. * Being one of the smartest kids in school will not make you happy. * Being one of the smartest men in the world will not guarantee you a perfect life, because a perfect life is impossible for anyone. 5. The fashion industry tries to sell lies to women all over the world that if you can become beautiful, your life will be perfect. But that is another fantasy lie straight from the pit of hell, Satan. They try to tell you that if you get certain clothes, you will be happy. That is why so many women have shopping addictions. * For a comical education on this watch the movie "Confessions of a Shopaholic." It is very good. Also "The Devil Wears Prada" is great. The beauty/fashion industry also says to women that if you get the perfect make up, you will be happy. * They tell you that if you can fit into a size 1 or 3 your life will be perfect, which is by far the WORST lie and leads to thousands, if not millions, of women to eating disorders of throwing up or starving themselves. Are those girls happy? No! Far from it! 6. Money is by far the biggest fantasy lie from Satan. Everyone thinks that if you could just win the lottery or inherit a million dollars your life would be perfect, but that is a another huge lie. * Money does not make people happy. The richest people in the world are often times the most miserable. Why? Because then think of all that you would have to worry about. The more you have, the more you have to worry about loosing yes? * This is why God says "Do not love the world or anything in the world" because anything in the world will only make you miserable and will only pull your heart away from God. So be very careful. It's very easy for any worldly thing to become an idol. It's easy to be deceived by so many things in the world. 7. Then there are drugs, which appeals mostly to young people because they aren't very intelligent yet.	They aren't educated enough on how much drugs can damage your body and your brain.

Exercise should be a major part of your practice! * Don't be mad if your opponent's score is much greater than yours. It will affect the way you play. Emotion is a very powerful thing. * If your opponent tips it over the net and runs back, tip it over. It will be hard for him to reverse direction. If he doesn't run back, hit it as far as you can. * Practice, practice, practise. It's true what they say, practice makes perfect. * In doubles confuse your opponents by hitting the shuttle between them so they are not sure which of them should go for it. * Always call the score at every point because you never know when your opponent will try to mess it up just to win. * Stay hydrated; it always helps. * Use efficient footwork. You should get to your shots in just one or two steps from a central base. Don't run about the court like a panicked chicken. "Sashay" to your shot, leading with your racquet foot. * Always warm up before playing this or any sport to play better and avoid injuries. * Do not play on a full stomach. * Disguise your shots. For example, if you are going to do a smash, maybe clear it or do a drop shot: this will catch them unaware, and you should win the point. * Position of your feet is important! One foot front, and the other at the back,you can easily lose your balance if your feet is in the wrong position. * Don't just whack it back to your opponent. Try some 'drop' shots, especially if your opponent is far back. * Communication is the key in doubles. Call for shots and tell your partner to 'leave' shots that are going out. Use visual communication, letting the player who cannot see his partner make the tactical decisions. For example, when you are in front of your partner, you decide which shots to take and where to move. Do it quickly, so your partner isn't left guessing. * Study your opponent's weaknesses. Is his backhand weak? Does he have difficulty returning smashes to the body, returning drops, moving backwards, etc? In doubles, is one player weaker than the other? Is one better at the net than the other? * Always return to the middle. * A backhand smash is good move to catch your opponent off guard. * Never rest! You should be in maximum motion. Always return to the center of your side, so that your opponent doesn't succeed in tiring you away. * If playing doubles, when you serve, the server should go close to the net forcing your opponents to hit it long. Your partner, who is behind you can then return it easily. * Practice a lot, and you will get better. * Always be ready. Your opponent can hit anywhere! * Don't rely on your arm. Instead work your wrist to conserve your stamina. Good wrist play also required to practice more advanced shot techniques. * Try to be unpredictable. Vary with different strokes. * Try not to jump up for a shot, most likely you'll stumble or not hit it the way you want to (unless you practice this a lot). Try to move backwards, or if playing doubles, trust your partner to get it. Only jump if you know you or your partner can't get it otherwise. * Teamwork is always needed in doubles. Try to attack at the empty place. Focus at the game. * When your opponent hits a clear to you, move back quickly to get behind it. With the shuttle now in front of you, you'll have lots of good forehand shots available. You'll be able smash effectively because you can hit it downwards. * Aim for the four corners of the opposite side. * Always shuffle fast to the birdie, never run. * Get rest before the game * When your opponent gives you a backhand shot, try to convert it to forehand by playing the round the head shot whenever possible. * Don't start play with more experienced players. Start with the beginners first, and then go to somebody better. You could get discouraged, but don't give up. Badminton is not as easy as it seems. * Try to play drop/net shots simultaneously in same direction and then as far as possible. This will make opponent tired and will panic to return the far shot which is unexpected to him. * Remember that badminton is a game of honesty and you get to call the hits that land on your side. * Always be precise with the service.	.

Flip a coin or use the stock pile to decide who plays first. If you have a coin with you, pick a side and flip the coin. Whoever chose the correct side of the coin plays first. If you want to use the stock pile, you and your friend need to take the top card from the stock pile. Whoever has the higher card plays first. * If you and your friend use the top card from the stock piles, place the card back to the bottom of the deck. 2. Use the stock pile to make a move. If you're playing first, remove the top card from your stock pile. Look at your tableau and decide what you want to do. To play a card, you must play a red card under a black card or vice versa. * For example, if 1 of the piles has a 7 of hearts on it and you pull a 6 of spades from your stock pile, you can place your 6 of spades below the 7 of hearts. * You must place the cards sequentially. A 6 must be placed after a 7, a 3 after a 4, a jack after a queen. * If you can't play a card from the stock pile, you can return it to the bottom of your stock pile. * You cannot place a red suited card under a red suited card or vice versa. 3. Make a move using the cards already on the tableau. You can also use the piles on the tableau to move. For example, if pile 6 has a 5 of clubs facing up and pile 3 has a 6 of diamonds facing up, move the 5 of clubs below the 6 of diamonds. After you've done that, flip the last card in pile 6 face up. * In fact, most of the game will be played using the piles on the tableau. 4. Change turns when you or your friend cannot make a move. When it's your turn, you can make as many moves as you'd like in a row. You lose your turn when you can no longer make a play with the top card on your stock pile or any of the cards on the tableau. * When your friend can't make a move, it's your turn to go again. 5. Move any aces to their own area. Unlike the other cards, aces don't need to be placed below the other cards in the tableau. If you have an ace, move it off to the side. When	.

Invite Fewer Guests. Not everyone can come, just your closest friends and relatives. Having a small guest list makes the cost of the hall that you rent and the cost of food much lower. Invite only the people that are closest to you like your immediate family and best friend. Everyone else will have to get over it. 2. Get Married During The Week. Most reception halls will give you a cheaper rate during the week. We went with thursday night and paid half the amount we would have for a saturday. 3. Do Your Own Catering: Some halls are flexible with this option. By doing your own catering you significantly cut down on your bottom line. 4. Book A Real Band! Expensive Agencies Charge You A Fee For Booking Their Bands. If you have money to burn wedding agencies are a good idea. Most of us don't, so deal directly with the bandleader or band manager. Make sure the band has a following and a regular gig. This will ensure that they are well rehearsed and on point. It's always a good idea to go see the band perform and see how people react to the music. Is the club packed or empty? How are people responding to the music? Does the band look energized and into the music? 5. Prioritize What Is Important. Do you want a party where everyone is dancing and having a good time?	Whatever your priorities are be sure to write them down.

Manage_a_Rack_in_Scrabble.txt	### Managing Your Rack for Word Recognition	If you can find both LOW and DOWN in the letters your rack ( with a separate W for each word ) , you can make the compound word LOWDOWN .	### Creating Words	For example , if you can find both LOW and DOWN in the letters your rack ( with a separate W for each word ) , you can make the compound word LOWDOWN .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><4>	Managing Your Rack for Word Recognition  1. Be willing to move your tiles around on your rack. Much of rack management in Scrabble is based on the ability to anagram words, that is, to rearrange the order of the letters you see into meaningful words. Initially, you'll find it helpful to physically move the tiles around on your rack until you see a word you recognize. As you play the game more often, you'll develop the ability to rearrange the letters in your head. * When rearranging tiles, it helps to place the tiles where they will most likely appear in the word. For example, letters like F and J are more likely to appear at the beginnings of words, while letters like S and Y are more likely to appear at the end. 2. Look for common prefixes and suffixes. Many words are formed by adding either a prefix to the beginning of the root word or a suffix to the end of the root word to change its meaning, tense, or part of speech. By recognizing these prefixes and suffixes when their letters appear on your rack, you can begin to make meaningful words out of the string of letters in front of you. * Common prefixes: Common antonym prefixes include UN-, IN-, IM-, DE- DIS-, MIS-, and NON-, with IG- a less common antonym prefix. Other common prefixes are EN-, used in words such as ENGAGE and ENROLL; RE-, used in words such as REBUILD and REPLAY; and PRE-, used in words such as PREPARE and PREPAY. When you find a prefix, you can move the tiles that make it up to the left side of your rack. * Common suffixes: Common plural suffixes include -S and -ES, with -EN a less common plural suffix. (Keep in mind that there are only 4 S's among the 100 Scrabble tiles, so you won't always want to try to make the plural form of a word.) The suffix -ED indicates past tense, the suffixes -ER and -EE identify people, -ER (-IER) and -EST (-IEST) identify comparatives and superlatives, and the suffix -ING can be added to verbs to make them into gerund nouns or participle adjectives. When you find a suffix, you can move the titles that make it up to the right side of your rack. 3. Look for other common letter combinations. Identifying blends, digraphs, and diphthongs such as CH, GH, OO, PH, PY, TH, TY, WH, and STR can also help you find words in the tiles on your rack. If you can't make a word that uses these combinations right away, you may want to hold onto the letters until the opportunity to play them comes up. * Once you find them, you can place these letter combinations on your rack in the place where you would most likely find them in the word, such as WH or STR at the beginning, OO in the middle, and TY at the end. 4. Familiarize yourself with common compound words. As you start to recognize common letter combinations used in words, you'll eventually start to recognize entire words themselves on your rack. The next step is to start putting small words together into compound words, either with 2 words found on your rack or with a word on your rack and a word already on the board.	If the word HEAD is on the board, you can turn it into GODHEAD or BULKHEAD if you have the appropriate tiles on your rack and there are enough free spaces ahead of the H.

Some good brands are Harrison's, Zupreem and LaFeber's. This should be supplemented by fresh veggies and fruits such as carrots, cucumbers, broccoli or apples, mangoes, etc. * When buying pellets keep in mind the size of your bird. Obviously bigger birds with large beaks are not going to eat tiny pellets. Also do some research on your particular pet bird type, be it a parrot, a cockatoo or a conure, etc. Different birds have varying nutritional needs. There are several classifications of bird types: here are the listings as well as their main foods and some types of birds that fall into that category: * Florivore Seeds, fruits, nuts, bark, roots, berries Military macaw, Blue and gold macaw, Red-faced parrot * Granivore Grains, seeds Budgerigar, cockatiel, Hyacinth macaw * Frugivore Mostly fruit and flowers; some nuts and seeds Blue-throated macaw, Green-winged macaw * Omnivore Seeds, fruits, insects, invertebrates Sulpher-crested cockatoo, Red-tailed Amazon * Nectarivore Nectar, pollen; some insects and seeds Lorikeet, lory. * In conclusion, educate yourself in order to accomplish the goal of having your bird be healthy and happy, make sure that their diet is well balanced and varied. Don't let your bird eat your pizza or hot dog, even though they may try to grab a bite.	.

Look for something to do near your home. Read local newspapers or join parenting groups to find out about activities or events that are happening in your area. Doing things in the area means that you won't have travel far with your toddler which can make an event stressful. If you have to return home, you're only a short trip away. * Planning an event nearby also means that you have more flexibility. If your child is sick or the weather is poor, you have more control over rescheduling than if you had planned on driving out of town and staying somewhere. 2. Take your toddler to something they're interested in. Consider what your toddler is curious about and try to foster that interest. For example, if your toddler is really active, think about taking them to an entry-level gymnastics class. Or if your toddler really loves animals, you could take them to the zoo for a few hours. * Ask your toddler if there's something they've always wanted to do. Your toddler may have some helpful suggestions, even if they just want to run around at the mall's kiddie area. 3. Find an activity or event that's kid friendly. You don't have to feel limited on where you take your toddler, but you should ask yourself if toddlers would be welcome. For example, while you could take your toddler to a large art festival, the crowds, lack of space for your toddler to walk around, and potential to break things might make you reconsider. *	You'll all be happier if you choose somewhere that's welcoming to families.

Make a new world. To do this, add the seed number, the name, and choose between story, creative, and hardcore mode. 2. Make a new character. To do this, just add the name and touch/click next. 3. Go through the introduction and find Ted. It may take a bit so just be patient. When you do find him talk to him and take his quest. 4. Get wood. To do this, go to the nearest tree and touch/click and hold the wood until it breaks. Then walk up to the block that fell and pick it up. 5. Repeat step four for as long as you want. 6. Put all the wood you collected into the crafting grid in your inventory, and tap/click and hold onto the planks it will show under the crafting grid until there is nothing left in the crafting grid. 7. Take out the crafting table you made during the introduction and place it. 8. Make some sticks. If you did the introduction right, you should know how to make them. 9. If you're lucky enough for it to still be daytime, find an oak tree and see if it has wax on it. If it does then collect the wax. 10. Find some coal. Search a cave, look under a low floating island, look in a river, or look on a cliff. 11. Make fire. You can find the crafting recipe in the crafting book (located in the inventory!). It will be in the items section of the crafting book. 12. Make some candles. The candle recipe will be located under blocks in the crafting book. 13. Place the candle and your crafting table where you want to stay for as long as you need. 14. Then, if it's night, just wait out the night. 15. When the next day breaks, find a cave or cliff. If you chose a cliff, then get all the ore from it and start a little mine. If you chose a cave, then get some stone from it and start a little mine. 16. Go to your crafting table and make some swords (the sword recipe is located under weapons in the crafting book.). 17. Find a cave and search it for ores. Keep going until you run into a monster. 18. If you don't find any gold, then repeat step seventeen until you have at least 16 gold ores. 19. Make some long swords. They will not be in your crafting book yet. You make them the same as stone swords except with gold instead of stone. 20. Go back to the first cave's monster and kill it. To do this, first destroy the spawner, then attack it with your gold swords until it dies. 21. Keep going getting ores until you run out of long swords. 22. Go back home and do Ted's quest. 23. Get his next quest. You will have to get 10 gold ore and 20 gold ore. 24. Do that quest. If you don't already have the gold and coal, then get it. 25. Then, before you go to Paula, make some flipper things (it's in the crafting book under armor) and kill the 20 sharks in teds next quest, after getting the quest. 26.

Select healthy spinach. Browse the spinach section at the store or farmer's market for bunches with dark green, fresh leaves. Don't get a bunch with yellow, wilted, bruised, or mushy leaves. It's important to select fresh spinach so that it can last long enough to be part of a tasty meal. At the grocery store, most of the spinach you find will already be separated from its stems and will be in a sealed bag. At the farmer's market, most spinach will come in a nice leafy bunch. * The most common type of spinach is smooth-leafed spinach, which has flat, smooth leaves that are perfect for cleaning. * Savoy spinach handles the cold better than other types of spinach.	.

Only put the eggs in motion when it looks as though the mixture on the bottom and sides is in danger of overcooking. * Try adding chorizo into your scrambled eggs. It makes a great addition. * Try adding chopped, cooked ham, bacon or smoked salmon to scrambled eggs to add flavor and color. Many stores sell meat substitutes suitable for vegetarians. * For a less fattening dish, use less butter or a substitute. Better yet, if you have a decent non-stick pan (Teflon), no butter or oil at all is needed. Try it - it works! (though keep in mind that a good butter or a high quality oil can work wonders on your eggs). * If you want eggs to be less runny on top, you can flip them over and cook them on the other side for a few seconds. * For something a little different, finely chop some onions, cook them in butter with salt and a pinch of sugar, and then add a beaten egg. Delicious! * Cooking eggs for too long causes the proteins in the eggs to squeeze out the moisture and you'll end up with your eggs floating on a puddle of water on your plate. * Serve with toast or a bagel. * Overheating will result in hard, rubbery eggs. Near the end of the cooking process you can prevent the pan from overheating by lifting it off the burner for a few moments at a time. * Consider cooking four eggs or fewer at one time. Trying to fix more than four is difficult, and conducive to using a lot more butter than is good for you! (In any case, if you don't eat vast quantities of butter in your other food, you might allow yourself to eat just a little more butter in scrambled eggs than the absolute minimum. Butter improves the flavor a lot more than too much cheese! Do not use margarine; a butter-Olive oil mix is ideal.) * Add extra flavor by mixing herbs like dill, oregano or basil into the egg mixture or sprinkling on top after cooking. * Add cinnamon and sugar to make it sweet. * You can add some cheese (Parmesan, mozzarella, cream cheese). * Halfway through the cooking process, rocking the pan will help any remaining liquid to cook up. * Use mainly egg whites if you have high cholesterol (2 egg whites, 1 yolk) *	.

This is putting a large strain on local authorities, and in some areas (such as the UK) these authorities are increasing the length between their trash pickups to save money, leaving households with more rubbish than ever.	.

Wait for dry, hot weather before you paint or prime. There's no point applying your paint to the asphalt when it's meant to rain that day. Check the weather forecast to make sure you can expect no rain for at least the next 24 hours. Your paint will dry best when it's warmer than outside. 2. Apply primer to the area before you paint. Buy asphalt or concrete primer at your local hardware or painting store. Use a roller with an extended handle to apply the primer to the area. The primer will take around 3 hours to dry when the temperature is . * Don't let the primer puddle or gather in certain areas. Use a cloth to spread puddled primer to other areas. 3. Select an oil-based paint if possible. Oil-based is the best choice as it's incredibly durable. However, oil-based paints have been banned in a lot of areas due to the effect they have on the environment. If oil-based paints are banned in your area, purchase some water-based paint instead. * If you're painting a parking lot or playground, calculate how much paint you'll need beforehand. Measure the width of each line you want and how long and wide each line will be. * Remember that you'll need different colored paints. Parking lots require blue paint for disabled parking spaces. Playgrounds will need a variety of different colors. 4. Use a brush or paint roller if working with a small area. If you're painting a playground and you need to be accurate, you can't go wrong using a paintbrush or paint roller. If you're painting a small parking lot, the roller will also do. * Get a soft to medium-bristled paintbrush. A hard-bristled paintbrush won't do the job as needed on the asphalt. * Use a large flat or striker paintbrush. Both of these paintbrush styles are great for exterior painting. * Get a roller in length. This size allows for accuracy and speed. 5. Rent a striping machine for a large parking lot. Striping machines are built like lawnmowers. You walk behind them and push them, and they will apply the paint to your asphalt. You simply add the paint to the striping machine and it will roll it onto your asphalt. Striping machines make applying paint to large areas much easier. * Pull the handle on the striping machine to roll the paint into the asphalt. Release the handle to cut off the flow of paint. * You can buy a striping machine from your local hardware store for $150 and upwards. *	It will be much cheaper to rent than the buy, especially if you're only using it for the 1 job.

Pass_a_Drug_Test.txt	### Passing a Urine Test	Drug testing laboratories all routinely test samples to detect dilution .	### Passing a Urine Test	However , drug testing laboratories all routinely test samples to detect dilution .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Drug><1><drug><3>	Passing a Urine Test  1. Recognize that urine tests are the most common drug test. If your employer requires a drug test, it is likely that you will be providing a urine sample. In rarer cases, an employer may also require a blood, saliva, or hair test. A urine test may be done privately (in a bathroom stall at a laboratory) or it might be observed by a laboratory employee. 2. Provide a list of your medications. False positive drug tests are very rare in licensed, reputable laboratories. However, certain prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal remedies can be mistaken for drugs of abuse in drug tests. For example, some decongestants might lead to a positive drug test for amphetamines. In order to ensure that your drug test does not provide a false positive, make a thorough list of all your medications and provide the list to your employer, along with any supporting documentation required. 3. Know what drugs are tested for in the 5-panel test. Urine tests can detect a variety of substances in your system. The particular drugs tested for are depend on a variety of factors: your personal or legal history, the requirements of your job, legal guidelines, or the occurrence of workplace accidents might all affect the specific drugs your employer chooses to test for. However, the most commonly administered drug test is the 5-panel urine test. Most 5-panel tests detect the following drugs: * Marijuana * Cocaine * Opiates * Phencyclidine (PCP) * Amphetamines 4. Know what other drugs are tested for. While the 5-panel test is the most common, some employers or legal personnel might choose to add other drugs to their screening. They might add testing for any or all of the following substances: * Alcohol * MDMA (ecstasy) * Barbiturates * Propoxyphene * Benzodiazepines 5. Know how long drugs remain in your system. A urine test does not test your sobriety at the exact moment at which you provided the sample. Instead, it tests your past use of drugs over the past few days or even weeks. Habitual drug users often have higher concentrations of the drug in their systems than occasional drug users. For this reason, habitual drug users may test positively for drugs even after being sober for several days or weeks. Other factors might affect the concentration of drugs in your system, such as your metabolism, quality and amount of drugs taken, hydration levels, and overall health. In general, however, you can expect a urine test to detect drugs for the following times: * Amphetamine: 2 days * Barbiturates: 2 days-3 weeks * Benzodiazepines: 3 days (therapeutic dose); 4-6 weeks (habitual use) * Cocaine: 4 days * Ecstasy: 2 days * Heroin: 2 days * Marijuana: 2-7 days (single use); 1-2+ months (habitual use) * Methamphetamine: 2 days * Morphine: 2 days * PCP: 8-14 days (single use); 30 days (chronic users) 6. Discontinue drug use for the proper amount of time. The only surefire way to pass a drug test is not to use drugs, especially when you are in the testing window. In some cases, you might know in advance when the test will take place. In other cases, however, you might not have any warning. In that case, consider whether your circumstances will make it likely for you to be tested for drugs in the near future. For example, discontinue drug use if you: * Are on the job market * Are on probation * Are in a profession that requires occasional random drug testing 7. Avoid spiking or masking the urine sample. This is a method used to throw off testing equipment from seeing certain results. Commercial and over-the-counter chemicals containing nitrates were once used to mask THC (the active drug in the marijuana plant) but are now commonly tested for. These products are all detectable, and will result automatically in a failed drug screen. 8. Consider the risks of diluting the sample. Dilution is the process of reducing the concentration of drug or drug metabolites in the sample. This is accomplished by adding fluid to the sample.	.

Most people (including me) just disregard this warning, but accidents can and do happen. * 1.:Keep the ‘Spring Guard’ on. We know that the spring guard surrounding the outer portion of the trampoline is always slipping off and getting in the way, and it’s very tempting to just rip the thing off and leave it in some forgotten corner of the backyard. But realize that the “Spring Guard,” no matter how annoying it may be, is keeping you and your siblings safe. Remember that one time your kid sister jumped off the safe portion of the trampoline and got her leg caught in the springs? If the spring guard had been there, your butt probably would have been saved, am I right? So heed my warning: Keep the spring guard on, and maintain it to make sure it doesn’t slip off while you’re playing. * 2\. Use a SOFT dodge ball. The rubber air balls used for kickball are not ideal, unless you are playing game option 3, because nobody can really throw the ball hard in mid-air. Nevertheless, don't intentionally aim for the head.	Those kind). The problem with the rubber kickball is that, while it is a very affective throwing device, will probably knock one of the little kids in the head while they are in mid-air causing them to spin up-side down landing them on their head or off the trampoline entirely (or both). Now I am aware of the problem: the dog has popped all of the plastic air balls and the only thing lying around is the rubber kick ball and a soccer ball. Looking at your options, you immediately think, “Well, the rubber ball is safer than the soccer ball.” And your second-grade mind is thinking logically, but you’re not considering the basic law of getting in trouble: Danger is not safer than More Dangerous. You’re going to get in trouble either way, so just put off playing the game until you can get another plastic air ball or two in the backyard. Yes! Trampoline Dodge Ball can be enjoyed with as many air-balls as you want at any given time. Just make sure the dangerous balls stay safe in the shed.

Create a written privacy policy. For most online businesses, written privacy policies aren't required by law, but it's still good business practice to have one and follow it. Your privacy policy explains to your customers what personal information you collect from them and how you use it. * You may be required by federal law to have a privacy policy for your customers in some situations, such as if you collect information from or about children. * However, even if the law doesn't require you to have a privacy policy, it's still a good idea to create one, make it available to your customers, and follow it scrupulously. * You can search online for simple and free privacy policy generators that you can use to help craft your own policy. * Generally, you should include information about how you use cookies on your website, such as to store your user's preferences or maintain information on items they've placed in their shopping carts. * State that any information collected will only be used to complete the customer's transaction, and will not be used for other purposes without the customer's consent. * Provide contact information so customers can file a complaint with the appropriate person in your company if they suspect the privacy policy has been violated or have any questions about how their data is collected and used. * If you use a third-party company for your shopping carts, check their policies to ensure your policy accurately reflects how they collect and use information. 2. Limit the sensitive information you store. The more of your customer's personal information you retain in your own system, the more that information is potentially exposed to hackers, leaving your customers vulnerable to identity theft. * You can limit your customers' exposure by not storing any more information than is absolutely necessary. * Understand exactly what information is being stored on your systems and where that information is located. You can't adequately protect information if you don't know where it is located. * Many customers find it convenient to create customer profiles and save their addresses and payment information so they don't have to retype it every time. However, avoid offering your customers this ability if you can't safeguard the information in those profiles. * Keep in mind that when a customer creates a profile, all of that information is potentially available to identity thieves. The bad thing about a customer profile is that it may contain all the information needed to steal their identity all together in the same place. *	This information isn't needed to complete a sale and is highly sensitive personal information.

Brush and floss your teeth. To keep your teeth healthy and resistant to infection, you should brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day. Brushing when you get up in the morning and before you go to bed at night will keep your mouth healthy and infection free. * Brushing and flossing reduces the risk of various infections in the mouth, including gingivitis. If your immune system is trying to fight off other infections, it is less likely to be able to fight off a thrush infection. 2. Keep your dentures clean. Cleaning them daily can remove food debris that can promote the fungus to grow. You should also remove your dentures nightly, so that fungus cannot begin growing beneath them. * Try removing your dentures at least a couple evenings every week when you are home and don't need to use them, in addition to taking them out while you sleep. This will help keep your mouth and dentures cleaner, which can minimize the chance of getting thrush. 3. Replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months. To keep your mouth clean, and to keep fungus at a minimum, you should replace your toothbrush regularly. Dentists generally advise that you should get a new toothbrush every 3 to 4 months. This minimizes the chance of the thrush fungus growing in your toothbrush and infecting your mouth. * A toothbrush that needs to be replaced will have worn and misshaped bristles. 4. Have regular dental cleanings. Getting dental cleanings several times a year can decrease your chance of getting a thrush infection. Regular dental cleanings help to minimize infections in general and will clean off all food debris that you can't remove from brushing and flossing. Your dentist will also be able to spot any signs that a thrush infection is starting in your mouth. * This is especially important if you wear dentures or have diabetes, as these are two risk factors for getting thrush. 5. Rinse your mouth after using a corticosteroid inhaler. Using an inhaler for asthma can increase your chance of getting thrush. To minimize this risk, rinse your mouth out with water after using it. Rinsing your mouth out will remove any excess medicine from your mouth. 6. Treat illnesses that can cause thrush. There are some diseases that, if left untreated, can increase your likelihood of getting oral thrush.	This is because having uncontrolled diabetes can increase the amount of sugar in your saliva, which increases the ability of the thrush fungus to grow. If you manage your diabetes with insulin and a controlled diet, your sugar levels and your risk of thrush will be minimized.

Begin training as soon as possible. As soon as you bring your puppy home, you should begin training it. Establish a pattern from the beginning by bringing your puppy outside to see if it needs to potty. Unless you are feeding it, training it, or playing with it, place it in a pen, or a small section of the house using a baby gate. 2. Take it outside every two to three hours. Because puppies do not have full control of their bladders yet, taking it outside frequently to use the restroom is very important. Taking it outside every two to three hours to go potty will begin to establish the boundaries for urinating and defecating. Once your puppy has gone potty outside, reward the correct behavior with praise and treats. * Also take it outside after naps, meals, and after play time to use the restroom. 3. Crate your Basset when it is unsupervised. Dogs are unlikely to soil the areas where they sleep, like their crates. A crate will teach your puppy to control its bladder and bowels.	Therefore, only keep it in its crate for short periods of time, for example, an hour at most.

Ask yourself which qualities you'd like to develop. Decide who you want to be at your core and identify the personality traits that version of yourself possesses in excess. These personality traits can be ones you already have or ones you've never demonstrated. * For example, one of your ideal qualities might be an ability to manage your time wisely. You may have had good time management skills when you started your career, but the monotony of everyday life may have encouraged you to slack off. On the other had, you may have always struggled with wise time management. Either way, if it is one of your ideal qualities, list it as such and work on developing it. 3. Put hope into action by setting goals. Optimism and hope are important, but no one every changed just by wishing it would happen. Redefining yourself takes time and hard work. *	Set a goal for the amount of time you want to dedicate each month to creative pursuits. Alternatively, set a goal for how much creative work you want to get done within a month regardless of the amount of time you spend on it.

Repel_Your_Unwanted_Crushes.txt	### Getting Rid of Your Unwanted Crush	If you are at work , mention how much you have to get done today .	### Letting Them Down Gently	For instance , if you are at work , mention how much you have to get done today .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><instance><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><If><1><if><4>	Getting Rid of Your Unwanted Crush  1. Say “no” if and when they ask on a date or for your number. If someone is crushing on you, they may ask you for your phone number or ask you out on a date. If you want them to get lost, say “no” sternly and forcefully so they don’t pester you with frequent invitations. Do this with a nice, polite tone so you don’t seem like the bad guy. * By turning them down, they may understand that you are not interested in them. * Say something like, “I’m not interested, but thanks for asking.” 2. Communicate your feelings honestly but gently so you don’t hurt them. If your unwanted crush continues to pester you with flirty comments or date ideas, it may be time to lay down the law. Pull them aside at school or at work so you can talk in private, or send them a text or instant message if you don’t see them in person often. Frame your words in a straightforward manner so they do not try to look for ways to convince you otherwise. * For instance, say something along the lines of, “I feel like you may want something more than just friendship with me, and I feel awkward not saying anything. Sadly, I don’t have these feelings for you too.” * You can also say something like, “I’ve noticed you acting really flirty with me. To clear the air, I just want you to know I’m not interested in being more than friendly with you.” 3. Avoid joking about the situation. Letting down your unwanted crush may seem awkward and uncomfortable, and it’s easy to laugh off the situation to make it seem less weird. However, this may lead your unwanted crush on, and they may assume that they still have a chance. Try to keep a friendly tone but be firm about how you feel. * Rather than laughing off the situation, try to diffuse the tension by talking about something else.	If you are at school, talk about the upcoming football game or big exam.

Measure your chair. Using a measuring tape, measure the height, length and width of the chair as a whole. If you're spending your hard-earned money on a slipcover, you will want it to fit well. 2. Go shopping for slipcovers. Slipcovers are available at most stores and websites carrying home furniture and decorating items. Slipcovers range in price from about $20 to as much as $150 depending on the material of the slipcover and the size of the chair.  * Have your measurements handy as you shop &mdash; most slipcovers will be advertised as fitting certain sizes of chair. If you're shopping at a brick and mortar store and need help, talk to an employee. * When in doubt, buy a slipcover slightly bigger than you think you'll need. You can always pull, sew, and trim a slipcover to make it smaller, but it's impossible to make a slipcover bigger. 3. Pick a fabric and pattern or color. While most slipcovers come in neutral shades to match a variety of decorating schemes, you can also find slipcovers in patterns and bright colors. Common fabrics include cotton, twill, suede and stretch denim, though many more are available. * For maximum durability, pick a slipcover made from a fairly sturdy fabric, like denim, thicker cotton/hemp blends, canvas, or twill. If you're not worried about durability, feel free to branch out &mdash; for instance, linen can look great, but some find it difficult to wash and maintain. 4. Vacuum the chair. As noted above, you'll want to remove any excess dirt and dust from your chair before putting its new slipcover on. However, it's not quite as urgent here &mdash; it's easy to take a bought slipcover off and vacuum again if you need to. 5. Pull the slipcover over the chair. 6.	.

But if you are under say 5'2" (yes, including children) many of these scooters may be too big for you. If your feet are not solidly on the floor or the reach to the controls is too far, it can be not only uncomfortable, but dangerous. You may not have adequate control or stability for full safety. We recommend buying a scooter that fits you properly. Make sure the seat can be adequately lowered so that your feet are flat on the scooter's deck and that the scooter's overall length is short enough that you can easily reach the controls. Review the technical specs. (see steps below)Short people are often overlooked when it comes to sizing seating of all sorts. Even dining room chairs and couches are often a problem. Right? For example, the standard height of a dining chair is 18"-20".	You may not notice it that much, but if you were suddenly careening around the corner like that, it would be pretty important. Honestly you don’t even have to be all that short to need a chair that accounts for shorter people. At Ray Mobility, we recommend Amigo's RT Express Jr. and have awarded it BEST Scooter for Short Rider. It meets our recommended requirements, and can be configured for anybody, which means your scooter can grow with you. See the link below for a more detailed discussion.

Find an attorney. Choose someone with whom you "click" and who shows that he or she understands your business. There will be many hurdles to leap as you go from working stiff to overworked and underpaid small business owner. Some of those hurdles will be composed of stacks of documents with rules and regulations, ranging from building covenants to city ordinances, county permits, state requirements, taxes, fees, contracts, shares, partnerships, and more. Having somebody you can call when the need arises will not only give you peace of mind, it will give you a much-needed resource who can help you plan for success. 2. Form a business entity. Decide what type of business you would like to be—–a corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship, co-op, etc. This is important for tax purposes and for attracting investors. This decision can be complex, so read widely on the advantages and drawbacks of each entity, and also give consideration to the newly evolving social enterprise style entities that some jurisdictions are allowing to form. If you're of a social entrepreneur bent, more socially-minded business structures may be just the ticket for your business. 3. Think money. How are you going to finance your business initially? The bank, venture capitalists, angel investors, Small Business Administration (SBA), your own savings: these are all viable options. Remember the four F's for investment: founders (people who share your idea), family, friends and fools. * When you start a business, be realistic. You will probably not roll out of the gate making 100 percent of whatever you project, so you need to have enough ready reserve to fund things until you are really up and running. One of the surest roads to failure is under-capitalization. * You may determine it will take $50,000 to start your business, and that's fine. You get your $50,000, buy your desks and printers and raw materials, and then then the second month arrives, and you're still in production, and the rent is due, and your employees want to be paid, and all the bills hit at once. When this happens, your only likely recourse will be to pack it in. If you can, try to have the reserves for a year of no income. * Plan to keep purchases of office equipment and overheads to a minimum when starting up. You do not need amazing office premises, the latest in office chairs and pricey artwork on the walls. A broom cupboard in the best address can be sufficient if you can artfully steer clients to the local coffee shop for meetings every time (meet them in the foyer). Many a business start-up has failed by purchasing the expensive gizmos instead of focusing on the business itself. 4. Chart your way to financial success. What price do you intend to sell your product or service for? How much will it cost you to produce? Work out a rough estimate for net profit—factoring in fixed costs like rent, energy, employees, etc. 5. Check out your competitors. Know how much are they selling a similar product for. Can you add something to it (add value) to make yours different and hence make it a more enticing price? For example, perhaps your company would like to provide an additional year of guarantee at no cost, or a repair part free-of-charge or an additional gadget with the initial item. * Competition isn't just about the goods or services themselves. It is also about your social and environmental credibility. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the need to show that your business is concerned with labor conditions and isn't damaging the environment. Certification endorsements from reputable organizations, such as labels and stars, can reassure customers that your product or service is more aligned with their values than one lacking the certification. 6. Keep a close eye on your running costs and keep them in line with your projections. Whether you're a $100 a year company, or a $100,000,000 company, you always need to know where your money is being spent. * It may be that you're running a bit more electricity than you had budgeted: take care of business, and turn off some lights.  * Whenever you see something spent wastefully—like electricity, phone plans, stationery, packaging—look around, and estimate how much really need, and minimize or remove the cost in every way possible. Think frugally when you start up, including hiring items instead of purchasing them and using pre-paid plans for services it needs instead of locking your business into long-term contracts. 7. Get a merchant account. A merchant account is a contract under which an acquiring bank extends a line of credit to a merchant, who wishes to accept payment card transactions of a particular card association brand.	.

Be patient with them. Just as you were capable of understanding that change is nothing to fear, others will come to realize this in time. You can do much to inspire people and calm their own fears by resisting your own, namely, that others can reject you! * Some things you may want to do may not be workplace-safe. If you really need your job, think twice before mouthing off, or getting a pink mohawk and 5 piercings, if you have to be at the investment bank in the morning. * Don't blame others for your decision to change. Don't say "I had to do this because of you"! Remember, you are deciding to change for yourself. * Note that after suppressing your own needs for so long, you may not be able to find them initially! Your partner says "Let's have hamburgers for dinner" and you may really think "Whatever is fine by me" while, it is only "fine" because you never make that choice.	Tell him or her that's where you want to go this time. Small things like this are good places to start practicing.

Turn the laptop off. Immediately remove the AC adapter and the battery. If the liquid touches the circuits on the laptop, then it will short out. 2. Unplug all peripherals such as mice and wireless cards. 3. Turn it upside down immediately. The liquid will stop going deeper into the laptop. 4. Clean the spilled liquid. Use a lint-free paper towel or cloth to clean. 5. Examine the keyboard. Some laptops have spill-resistant keyboards. * Pour out the liquid contained in the keyboard enclosure. * Remove and clean an easily removable keyboard. 6. Clean the sticky residue. The screen, the keyboard and the buttons may be dirty. Use a lint-free cloth that is clean and slightly wet. 7. Insulate yourself from static discharge. Static electricity can damage any computer. Learn how to ground yourself to avoid destroying a computer with electrostatic discharge. 8. Take apart the case. You may need to take apart the case if you cannot clean the whole spill. Some spills can damage the circuit boards. * If you don't feel like taking your laptop apart, then have someone else do it. * Remove all cards and drives as possible. 9. Remove dry residue. Use a lint-free cloth to gently remove non-water stains. Use compressed air or a vacuum cleaner to blow away the residue. 10. Rinse off the residue. If you spilled anything that is not water, then rinse it clean. There are several ways to rinse your machine, depending on the kind of spill, and how much risk you are willing to endure: * Think about what has been spilled on/in your computer, and determine whether it is water soluble or not. Use deionized water for water-soluble stains such as cola. Otherwise, rinse with alcohol then water. * Rinse with water. Take any components that have residue and rinse them under water. Most circuit boards handle water as long as they are not powered. Moving parts such as CD drives and fans may not handle water well. * Rinse with deionized or distilled water. Many people choose deionized water over tap water. Regular water will leave deposits that can cause electrical shorts, but deionized water will not. * Rinse as much as possible and carefully remove excess water. 11. Let it dry. Make sure that the parts are dry. As with rinsing, there are different theories on drying: * Dry naturally. Prop the machine up, away from surfaces, so that air can circulate in and around the entire unit. Leave the machine to dry for 24 to 48 hours. While it is drying, place the laptop battery in uncooked rice. * Dry with light heat. Use moderately warm sources of heat. Let it dry for approximately 12 hours.	.

Unplug appliances when you're not using them. If your electricity costs seems too high, unplugging items you're not using can be a great way to cut down on costs. * Kitchen appliances like coffee machines and toasters should always be unplugged after use. Even if they're not turned on, simply being plugged in means they drain energy from the wall. * Electronics are also a major contributor to your overall electric bill. Things like the your TV, computer, and phone chargers do not need to be plugged in if they're not in use. Unplugging electronics can save costs on your monthly bills. * If you have air conditioning, be careful about when you use it. Try to only turn it on between mid-afternoon and early evening, as those are the times of day when it gets most warm. If possible, leave the AC off overnight and rely on a ceiling fan or floor fan. 2. Save on water. If you pay for your own water, there are a variety of ways you can cut back on costs. * If your shower head was made before 1994, you should replace it. Federal regulation requires models made after that year to be more energy efficient and they will not use as much water during showering. * If you do not like drinking tap water, invest in a cheap filtration. A Briita filter can be bought at a supermarket or online for around $20 or $30. Filtering tap water is cheaper over time than buying bottle water each week. * If you have a washing machine, wash your clothes in cold water. This cuts down on water heating costs. It might also be better for nicer clothing as it reduces the risk of your clothes shrinking or the colors fading. 3. Cancel your cable subscription. If you subscribe to cable, you might want to cancel your subscription. While many people enjoy television as entertainment, a subscription to a service like Hulu Plus or Netflix allows you to view a lot of programs online for only $7-$10 each month.	If there's a show you really like that you cannot see without cable, consider scheduling weekly viewing parties with friends who also like the show and have cable.

Check your calendar. See if you are free on the appointed date and time. If you previously accepted another invitation for that time, you will have to decline the new one. 2. Make up your mind by the date specified on the invitation; if a "reply by" date was not listed, reply within 24 hours of receiving the invitation. What if something better comes up later? That doesn't matter. Maybe it will, maybe it won't, but it is rude not to reply quickly to any invitation and show up as promised. 3. Don't leave your potential hosts in suspense. If you want to hold your schedule open, the proper response to an invitation is, "Thank you for the invitation, but I'm afraid I will not be able to attend" -- saying, "No thanks," instead of, "Please wait until I see what else comes along." True, you might not get a better offer after all, and if you turn down the invitation, you could end up having nothing else to do that night, but you are abusing the graciousness of your hosts if you keep them on the string as your back-up plan. 4. Reply in writing or in kind. To be most proper, one would reply in writing, by hand. But one may reply in the same format that one was invited; for example, an email invitation can be answered by email. For an RSVP to a wedding or other formal event, write the reply on a small plain piece of stationery, mirroring the layout of the initial invitation. The lines are centered. Write in the third person.	If unable to attend, change "accepts with pleasure" to "regrets that she is unable to attend." You never need to give a reason for not attending. Just let the host know whether you're currently planning to be there or not.

This can destroy any vegetation underneath the fire surface, and the damage may be more severe if the fire was lit over concrete or tiles. The solution is to build a temporary platform to keep the fire above the ground, thus avoiding damaging it. This article explains the simplest possible solution; while it is by no means the only solution to creating fire pit, this one is within the capacity of most people using materials easily salvaged from your yard or from a friendly neighbor. This pit comprises 12 zinc sheets (90cm x 70cm / 35.4cm x 27.55cm) which will combine to make a platform around the size of 160cm x 160cm / 63" x 63". Thirty bricks are used to support the double layered design of the pit. The top layer will serve the obvious function of holding up the fire.	The bottom layer serves several functions including:

Corner time should be no longer then 15-20 minutes. 2. Make sure your child knows what they have done wrong. Have them explain it to you. 3. Choose correctly. These are normal child behaviors that do NOT deserve a punishment: nose picking, being messy, or wanting it their way).In cases like this, talking to your child should be enough. Other things like temper tantrums, or loud disrespectful noises DEFINITELY deserve punishment. 4. If you choose to spank, do not spank angrily, and NEVER with implements. 5. If you choose to confiscate possessions, do NOT take away more than 3-4 items. Depending on what they did, you may give it away. For example.	If they had a temper tantrum and tried to hit/kick you, give it away. It totally depends on behavior.

Sometimes it's better to get four hours of sleep and cram what you can in the morning rather than be in a complete dreamworld for the test. * If you wear contacts, take them out before you start so you're not distracted by rubbing them all the time. * Avoid coffee or soda until just before the test. If you drink a lot of it while studying, you will completely crash a few hours later. But if you really must, your best bet is to take a small gulp then sip an energy drink through out the night. It will wake you up then keep you up. Side note, energy drinks have ingredients in them that actually aid memory retention. Also, think about what time you want to go to sleep. Stop drinking about a hour before this time. This will make sure you die down a little so you can actually go to sleep. It's a really good idea to have two cans on hand. One can for the night and another if you need a kick before the test or throughout the day. * Spicy food is a great way to keep yourself awake. If you're pretty resistant to spicy food, try some extra spicy Asian Noodle Dishes or Burrito with Habenyaro Hot Sauce. I doubt you'll be able to fall asleep while you're panting and glugging down all that ice water. * Before you leave for the test, jump around, do push-ups, and get pumped up and awake. Be ready to do well on the test. You worked hard for it, and you probably know a lot more than you think. * If you feel your eyelids drooping: pinch yourself, rub your face with a piece of ice, stand up, run in place, and do a few jumping jacks to get an adrenaline rush, or, if at worst, take a ten minute nap. Be careful with naps! (See below for how to nap in an all-nighter.) * Napping: Take them for about ten minutes. Set a loud timer to wake you up, and stay half-awake. Short naps refresh you. Anything longer and you'll fall into a deep stage of sleep, which will leave you groggy when you are forced awake. *	.

Having charismatic body language is the most important criteria to being persuasive. * Read to a thesaurus and dictionary on your free time. Intelligent people have a tendency to have interest in these areas, and expanding your vocabulary will associate you with intelligent people. * If you aren't skilled at using idioms (hit the jackpot, the 411 etc.) then avoid them whenever possible. * Sometimes it's best to keep your mouth shut (when you are tired, drunk, stoned, extremely angry etc). When you're in these states, some of the things that come out of your mouth may be laughed at or otherwise used against you for months or years afterward. *	When an argument is debunked, anyone supporting it becomes wrong. For example, when someone says "I told you the Coriolis Effect does not work in toilets", and you never said you agreed with that hypothesis, simply ask "Did I say it did?". Make sure it's not in a defensive tone, but more of a surprised tone that you would ever have thought such bogus.

Make things better: find new movies or songs. Watch or listen at the same time and over and over again 2. Swallow saliva. and then bite your tongue. 3. Practice long, slow deep breathing every day. Visualize a peaceful place as you breathe. 4. Take a really deep breath, during any occasion on which you feel that you might cry, and let it out calmly and coolly. You might even try to think of something that makes you laugh. OR, when you find yourself in a situation in which you are likely to cry, try your long, slow, deep breathing and visualization. There's no need to wait until you're fighting the impulse: start a little earlier than you think you'll need to and continue a little longer than you think is necessary. Be ready to retreat to a safe place if you have to. 5. Once you're certain you're fine, return to your normal breathing pattern. 6. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. 7. Blink a few times and look into the light; this makes your pupils constrict and keep tears from falling. 8. Cross your eyes. This is also another way to prevent tears from forming. Rolling your eyes works the same way. 9. Pinch yourself, or bite your tongue -- your mind will focus on the pain instead of the emotion. Don't pinch so hard that you cry from the pain, though. 10. Get a stress squeeze toy. It really helps release all the negative energy that's all inside. Screaming helps too sometimes. Get something to scream into that makes it muffled and quiet. 11. Lift your head to the sky. This way you can cry a little, get the sun in your eyes, or blink the tears away without anybody seeing. 12.	Emotion comes from the right side of the brain. Doing even simple addition and subtraction activates the left side of your brain and can circumvent the emotional response you're having. Times tables also help.

Refrigerator, Freezer and Fridge: 1. Put each cooling device in a place which is as cold as possible, away from heat sources like radiators, direct sunlight or other big energy consuming devices. 2. Check that the cooling device is at least 5cm (2 inches) away from the wall, and that the air can circulate well. 3. Increase the inner temperature of the cooling devices. 7°C (45°F) is enough for the fridge and -18°C (0°F) is enough for the freezer. 4. Keep the cooling devices tidy; label the items in the freezer, so that you can get to the food as quick as possible. It's not working efficiently whenever the door is open so standing there with the door wide open digging for the cholchlate-fudge sundaes isn't a good idea. 5. Fill unused space with padding such as polystyrene, newspaper or just a blanket. 6. Keep the doors of these devices closed. 7. Check the sealing gasket of the cooling devices: Put a switched on torch (or flashlight) in the fridge and close the door. Can you see the light? Check if the sealing gasket is damaged, and buy a new one if necessary. 8. Act energy efficient. Let food cool down before you put it in a cooling device and slowly defrost food from frozen food in the fridge. 9. Defrost the freezer if there's a layer of ice. 2. Lights: 1. Find the most effective places for lights and light switches. 2. Paint your rooms in a bright color. More light is reflected by brighter walls and so you need less light to make your room bright. 3. Replace regular light bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs. It is economical to replace a light bulb if it burns for more than half an hour a day. Use high quality L.E.D. - Light Emitting Diode (Best type) or C.F.L - compact fluorescent bulbs. 4. Don't use ceiling floodlights, unless they are L.E.D. types. 5. Install and use dimmer switches at less than full brightness for incandescent lamps and other types (CFL, LED, etc.) that are specifically labeled as suitable for use with a dimmer. 3. Stove: 1. Use the right saucepan, frying pans etc when you cook. Use pots with a diameter that is as small as possible. Put these pots only on hobs that fit to them or are smaller. Try to use a pressure cooker if you're cooking for a considerable time. Check that the bottom of the pot is even. Keep the pots closed as long as possible. Without a lid you'll loose about 2/3 of the energy. 2. Reduce the amount of water you use while cooking. 3. Turn the stove off 5 minutes before you reach the cooking time. 4. Choose a gas stove, if practical, or an induction cooker if you buy a new stove. 5. Boil water with an electric kettle instead of the stove. 4. Oven: 1. Don't preheat the oven unless necessary. 2. Bake with circulating air. 3. Use the oven several times if it's already hot. 4. Keep the oven's door closed as long as possible. 5. If the oven has already reached the final temperature turn it off 10 minutes before the food is ready. 6. Use a toaster or the microwave if possible instead of the oven. 5. Dishwasher and washing machine: 1. Check if these devices are connected with the hot water pipe. 2. Make the devices as full as possible. 3. Reduce the water temperature and use energy and/or water saving modes. 6. Avoid the air conditioner. You need 3 times more energy per degree to cool a room than to heat a room. 1. Ventilate during the night or early in the morning in order to store the coolness for the day. 2. Keep the coolness in the house during the day. Close the shutters and keep your windows and doors closed. 3. Use a fan instead of an air conditioner. 7. Avoid heating with electric energy. While electric heat is the most efficient, it is often the most costly. If you use another energy source (natural gas, propane or heating oil) you can save money on electricity. 8. Avoid the clothes dryer. Dry your wet clothes on a laundry line. If you are unable to follow this step because you don't have access to a clothesline, fill the dryer reasonably full, but not so full that air cannot circulate, and use the mode "iron-dry". 9. Optimize the energy consumption of your PC. Modern PCs can be set up to enter energy saving modes from both the BIOS settings page and directly from the Windows Operating system. Enable "Sleep" and "Hybrid Sleep" for desktops and "Hibernation" for notebook PCs running Windows. 10. Gather up as many monthly electric bills as you can. You will want to have these on hand so you can see how much you are saving. 11. Change your regular light bulbs to more efficient light bulbs. LED and CFL bulbs use a lot less electricity and last a long time, several times longer than incandescent bulbs. They do cost more than regular bulbs so you probably don't want to change them all at once. The high purchase price is compensated by their long life and low energy consumption. Your local utility may offer reduced price or even free CFLs from time to time. Check with them before purchasing. See warnings for important information on fluorescent light bulbs and their safe disposal. 12. If you cannot or choose not to change to fluorescent light bulbs, consider using a lower powered bulb. A 100 watt light bulb used 6 hours per day will cost in excess of $25 per year (.12 / kWh rate). If you can get by with a 40 watt light bulb, that cost will be about $10. Imagine if you did that to every light bulb in the house. 13. Turn off the lights when you leave the room. Use the above costs to determine how much you can save. Remember to count the total number of bulbs as many light fixtures will have 2 or more light bulbs. 14. Turn off all household appliances like TV's and computers when not being used. You can easily waste hundreds of dollars a year leaving these on when not being used. 15. Set your thermostat wisely. Most homes have programmable thermostats and if you don't have one, it would be well worth it to buy one. There is no reason to heat or cool your house when everybody is at work or school. Many homes are empty for 8 or more hours a day and there is no reason to have the house at the same temperature that you want it when you are home. 16. Seal your windows and doors. You can get a tube of caulk for a couple dollars. If you seal up all those cracks around the windows that let the outside air in, you can realize substantial savings. 17. If you live in a place where you are allowed to choose your electric company, you can easily save 20% just by switching energy companies. Check the resources section for more information. 18. Each month when your bill comes, dig out your old bills and see how much you have saved. Sometimes, you will want to compare your bill to the previous month to get a good comparison. Sometimes, you will want to compare to the same month the previous year. 19. For the Very Frugal Use cold water for just about everything except for taking a very short shower. Cold water can be used for laundry, washing hands, dishes and almost all other everyday uses. Taking a very short shower isn't really hard to do. First, flip up the tub lever so that it will hold water.	Turn water off. There will now be a small puddle in the tub. Use a bathbrush or washcloth to lather up by using the puddle of water in the tub. When lathered up good, shampoo hair last. Doing this last prevents the shampoo from dripping down into your eyes while you're lathering up. Then, flip the tub lever so the tub drains and then turn the shower on warm for about 15 - 20 seconds to rinse off. All done! You have now saved water and saved on your utility bill.

Pay attention to her tone of voice and body language. Consider why she is asking. If you have an idea about how she feels, it will help you have a more productive conversation with her. We communicate mainly through our tone of voice and body language, so try to understand what is going on using these signals. * If she is raising her eyebrows, she might be uncomfortable. This might mean that she does not want you to like her. * If she is mirroring your body language, then you are probably connecting. Perhaps she hopes that you like her back or she feels connected to you and wants you to know that she doesn’t want the same thing. * If she is making lots of eye contact, this shows interest. But it could go both ways, she could be interested in knowing how you feel because you are close and she doesn’t want anything or because she really does want something to happen between you. * A group of gestures together shows that she feels connected to you. For example, if she is smiling, she has her head titled to the side and she is holding or touching her face at the same time. This probably means that she does like you. If she is doing a cluster of gestures, this could mean that she likes you. However, always believe what she says over any other signals you get. * Crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you. This might mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings. 2. Do not assume too much. Once you have considered how she feels, you do not have to over think it or change your mind several times. The truth is that you do not know for sure how she feels. And you will not know until you have asked her straight out how she feels.	.

Lower your stress levels. Do your best to remove any excessive pressure in your daily life. This can mean emotional or physical engagements that cause tension and exhaustion. Give yourself time to relax every day of the week. Set a specific time of the day for relaxation. It might be best to rest right after a period of activity. * Try meditation. Meditating for a few minutes every day can significantly reduce your stress levels. Sit in a quiet place where you are free from distractions. Close your eyes and take deep breaths. Try repeating a positive sentence like, “I am calm,” in your head. Alternatively, you can let your mind rest by only focusing on your breath. There are several techniques for meditation. Find one that works best for you. * Practice being present. Take a few minutes to notice exactly what is going on in the moment. This can be done by focusing on your senses. Pay attention to how the environment feels on your body or the texture of your favorite snack. * Laugh out loud. Laughing improves your mood by releasing a brain chemical called endorphins. Sit back with a funny movie or television show or watch some funny clips online. * Listen to music. Make a playlist of your favorite relaxing songs. Curl up in your favorite spot on the couch and listen to the music. You may also enjoy listening to a playlist of nature sounds. These also serve as relaxing background sounds as you cook or get ready for bed. 2. Improve your sleep habits. People with CFS usually report that they do not sleep well, or that they do not feel refreshed after a full night’s sleep. Don’t add more difficulties to your rest time. Create a sleep schedule that you can stick to. Make an effort to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Avoid taking long naps during the day that will throw off your sleep schedule. Sleep for eight or nine hours every night. * Adjust your evening routine. Do relaxing activities like reading, taking a bath, or listening to quiet music before bed. Give yourself an hour to wind down from the day and relax your body and mind. Avoid stimulating activities like exercise, intense conversations, or computer time. * Do not go to bed on a full or empty stomach. Have dinner about two hours before you go to sleep. Avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee, sodas, or energy drinks at least four hours before bedtime. * Consider taking over-the-counter medications. Your local drug store should have non-prescription sleep aids like melatonin, valerian, and various antihistamines. 3. Take it easy. Keep a steady pace with your daily activities. Strike a balance between work, socializing, and relaxation. Try to maintain the same level of daily activity. Do not overwork yourself even if you’re feeling great. You may push yourself too hard and feel unwell for days afterward. 4. Graded exercise can cure certain people with chronic fatigue syndrome. The key to cure yourself--completely--of chronic fatigue syndrome is to get into top physical health (through both diet and exercise). If you can only do thirty seconds of an exercise while in bed, try it. Do only what you can, but aim to build up over time. While this may seem impossible, gradual intensity increases may bring you to top physical shape within two years (or longer). Start off by doing bed exercises like lifting your arms (as if doing jumping jacks). Once you gain stamina, try chair yoga. Later, add leg and arm weights to your chair yoga. After that, try walking a little ways. Increase your duration over time. Later, lift weights or do lighter activities in the gym. Gradually pick up the pace with high intensity interval training, weights, calisthenics, and cardio. But do so with a significant revision of your diet. 5. Take cold showers. Hot showers harm (by reducing your energy). Cold showers heal (by boosting your energy and immunity). Go cold for basic washing needs, but try ice cold for the final blast. Cold showers could add precious minutes of energy to your day. * Notice what makes you tired. People with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome tend to lose energy from both mental and physical activity. Take note of the things that wear you out. Avoiding filling one day with a lot of activity and taking another day off. Try to spread your engagements evenly throughout the week. 1. Avoid toxins. Makeup is a neurotoxin. Other household toxins include toothpaste, most shampoos and conditioners, face lotions, and deodorants. Instead of toothpaste and deodorant, use baking soda with organic virgin coconut oil. Instead of face cream, use organic virgin coconut oil scented with a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil. Seek non-toxic shampoos and conditioners.	As for a window / bathroom / kitchen cleaning products, use a solution of 1/2 cup of white vinegar, 3 cups of water, and 20 drops of an essential oil (like lavender, orange, lime, or eucalyptus essential oil).

Check for roof damage above water marks on the ceiling. If you haven’t already tracked down the leak, trace the water damage inside your home. If you have an attic, head up there with a flashlight, and look for water stains or mold. Note the location of any evidence you find, then inspect the corresponding spot on the exterior of your home. * If your roof is slanted, inspect areas that are higher than where you’ve found interior evidence of a leak. Water enters the leak then, due to gravity, it gets into the attic at a point farther down the roof’s pitch. * If you have trouble, run a hose for 1 to 2 minutes along different sections of the roof. Have a person inside alert you when they spot water. 2. Inspect your shingles, flashing, and vent boots. Look for curled, cracked, or missing shingles at the leak site, and evaluate your roof’s overall condition. See if there are numerous failing or missing shingles, wide gaps where roofing material meets vents or a chimney, and other signs of widespread wear and tear. * Repairing 1 or 2 shingles and resealing minor gaps are relatively easy fixes.	.
Tell_if_a_Dog_Is_a_Girl_or_Boy.txt	### Part Two: Noting Behavioral Differences	Puppies who only give the occasional lick are likely doing so out of momentary affection , and not as a result of any grooming instinct .	### Noticing Behavioral Differences	However , puppies who only give the occasional lick are likely doing so out of momentary affection , and not as a result of any grooming instinct .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Puppies><1><puppies><3>	Part Two: Noting Behavioral Differences  1. Only watch urination habits after the first few months. Young puppies urinate in identical manners regardless of which sex they are. Paying attention to the way a puppy urinates only becomes a reliable judge of gender after six months. * During the first few weeks, puppies will not be able to control their bowel movements or urination at all. * Even after the puppies are strong enough to stand and control their habits, all puppies will squat while urinating for the first two months. Many male puppies need as many four to six months before developing the urination habits of adult dogs. * After six months, most male dogs will lift their legs while urinating, while female dogs will continue to squat. 2. Watch for marking. After a few months, male puppies may begin to mark their territory. Female puppies lack this instinct, however. * The urge to mark his territory will be especially strong in male puppies who have not been neutered. Neutering a puppy will greatly reduce his urge to mark. * The exact age when male puppies begin to mark will vary from puppy to puppy, but most will start between two and six months. Some male puppies may begin marking before they learn to lift their leg while urinating. * Watching the puppy carefully will determine whether a puppy is merely urinating or whether it is marking its territory. A dog that urinates quickly in many different locations is likely marking, especially if he intentionally urinates after thoroughly smelling each spot. Dogs that only urinate once or twice generally aren't marking, even if they stop to smell many different spots during a walk. 3. Note that female dogs will go into heat. Female puppies who have not been spayed will go into heat on a semiannual basis. The first heat cycle will occur when the puppy is between six and ten months old. * Female puppies in heat will produce a vaginal discharge. You can put dog "diapers" on to reduce the mess it causes, but in many cases, it will be easiest to simply keep the dog confined in a designated area that can be cleaned later. * Each heat cycle will last for approximately three weeks. 4. Consider affection with caution. Both male and female dogs can be equally affectionate, so this is more indicative of a puppy's personality than the puppy's gender. * Female puppies do have a greater tendency to show affection through licking than male puppies, however. This results from the female puppy's instinct to groom other pack members. Expect the licks to be strong and precise. *	As such, you can expect the occasional lick from both male and female puppies.

Watch urination habits after the the dog is at least 6 months old. Young puppies urinate in identical manners regardless of which sex they are. However, after 6 months most male dogs will lift their legs while urinating, while female dogs will continue to squat. Paying attention to the way a puppy urinates only becomes a reliable judge of sex after about 6 months. * During the first few weeks, puppies will not be able to control their bowel movements or urination at all, so it is useless to use urination stance at this point. Even after the puppies are strong enough to stand and control their habits, all puppies will squat while urinating for the first 2 months. Many male puppies need as many 6 months before developing the urination habits of adult dogs. 2. Be on the look out for marking. Once male dogs are a few months, they may begin to mark their territory. This is a pretty good behavioral marker of sex because female puppies lack this instinct. * The urge to mark his territory will be especially strong in male puppies who have not been neutered. Neutering a puppy will greatly reduce this urge. * The exact age when male puppies begin to mark will vary from puppy to puppy, but most will start between 2 and 6 months.

A dog that urinates quickly in many different locations is likely marking, especially if he intentionally urinates after thoroughly smelling each spot. Dogs that only urinate once or twice generally aren't marking, even if they stop to smell many different spots during a walk. 3. Watch for signs that the dog is going into heat. Female dogs who have not been spayed will go into heat on a semiannual basis. The first heat cycle will occur when the puppy is between six and ten months old. The signs that a female dog is in heat include the vulva swelling and discharge being released from the vulva as well. * Female dogs in heat will produce a vaginal discharge that can be clear, brown, or bloody, depending on the point in their reproductive cycle they are in. * You can put dog "diapers" on to reduce the mess it causes. However, in many cases it will be easiest to simply keep the dog confined in a designated area that can be cleaned later. * Each heat cycle will last for approximately three weeks. 4. Don't use personality or general behavior as an indication of sex. Both male and female dogs can be equally affectionate, defensive, active, and calm. These aspects of their personality do not indicate anything about a dog's sex. *	.

Understand the diagnosis. Before considering any treatment, make sure you fully understand the diagnosis. A pinched nerve is when a nerve is damaged in some way and unable to fully send its signals. * It can be caused by compression to the nerve, a herniated disc, arthritis, and bone spurs. * Pinched nerves can occur all over the body, although they are the most common in the spine, neck, and wrists/elbows. * Poor nutrition and general health can worsen a pinched nerve. * Its symptoms include numbness, sharp pain, tingling, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness. 2. Get some rest. The easiest way to get a bit of immediate pain relief is to rest the area that was damaged. * Avoid overworking the area that was injured by doing repetitive movements or heavy lifting. * Sleeping extra hours is the natural way for your body to repair damage. If necessary, take some extra bed rest time. 3. Use a brace or splint to immobilize the injured area. This will allow you to do some basic work like usual. *	.
Take_Care_of_a_Siberian_Husky.txt	## Steps	Dog paws have a few sweat glands .	## Steps	Also , dog paws have a few sweat glands .	<insert><Also><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Dog><1><dog><3>	Steps  1. Prepare for owning a husky. Alaskan Huskies were originally bred to go long distances in cold weather. A successful indoor pet husky can be achieved by maintaining an above average exercise schedule. Healthy pet huskies need the equivalent of three to five miles of exercise four days a week. This exercise can be in the form of running, playing with other dogs, swimming, and one-dog sledding type sports such as bikejoring. 2. Exercise keeps a husky happy. The downside to this is that a husky may not know when it is time to stop running. It is an important owner responsibility to decide their husky has had enough before they injure themselves or overheat. 3. Be aware that heat and humidity are hard on huskies. Temperatures above 65ºF (18ºC) are bordering on too hot to exercise. If there is a breeze, low humidity, or your dog can easily cool off in water, you may be able to exercise at these temperatures. Keep in mind that racing sled dogs do not work very hard unless the temperature is below 20ºF (-6ºC). Keep warm weather exercise sessions less than 3 miles long (less than 5K). 4. Keep your husky cool. The larger the dog, the harder it is to stay cool. Dogs stay cool through panting. Larger dogs have more body heat to get rid of, so it takes time for them to cool. If you have a large husky – 60+ pounds(27kg+) – take extra precautions in the heat. 5. Decide whether to shave your husky or to leave their coat alone. Fur helps regulate body temperature. Most huskies have a double coat, with the exception of the Eurohounds. This coat consists of a thick undercoat and a guard hair layer. These layers keep your husky warm and cool. That said, under some circumstances, you may want to shave your husky. Shaving can help keep the skin dry if your husky swims a lot and can allow you to find fleas, ticks, and hot spots. 6. Keep fleas under control. Fleas can cause skin irritations and carry parasites. You have to be diligent about combing through your husky to keep on top of a possible flea infestation. 7. See the vet regularly. Huskies that live outdoors are at a greater risk of parasite infestations like heart worm, and diseases such as rabies. Make sure your husky has flea, tick, and heart worm protection, and has an annual veterinary checkup. These issues are easily prevented. 8. Care for them no matter the climate or season. Alaskan huskies often thrive better in cold weather, but care is still involved.	The warm foot against the cold snow can lead to the snow getting stuck between your husky's paws. Dog booties are the best remedy for this. Huskies do get cold. If your husky spends time outdoors, he is going to need a warm dog house. A warm dog house has a few key features:

"""""""	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><Instead><1><instead><4>	Writing Your Speech  1. Write a brief introduction. The introduction will set the tone for the rest of your speech, so try to express gratitude and connect with the audience right away. A light-hearted joke to open your speech is fine, but avoid sarcasm or joking about the merits of the award itself. The exact length of your introduction will depend on how much time you're allotted to speak, but generally, you should try to keep it brief. * For example, you could write “I am so honored to be standing here today to receive this community leadership award. Serving my community has been a joy and a privilege that I am grateful for every single day. I wouldn't be able to do it if it weren't for all the amazing people in this city." 2. Write the body of your speech, focusing on the people you want to thank. The bulk of your speech should be devoted to showing gratitude and thanking the people that helped you get the award. Reference the list you made of people you want to thank and include them in the body of your speech. * Be selective about who you plan to thank in your speech. You probably don’t want to thank all twenty members of your extended family or name off every person in the organization that is honoring you. You don’t want your audience to grow impatient as you read through a long list of names. Only thank people involved with the award you’re receiving and your immediate support system (your spouse, your children, your parents, etc). * You don’t have to thank everyone by name in your speech.	.

Determine the ticker symbol for the stock you want to track. * The ticker symbol will be a combination of up to five letters, often abbreviating or suggesting the name of the company or one of its products. 2. Find out which exchange the stock is traded on. * The major U.S. exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). Internationally, the London and Tokyo stock exchanges are closely watched. * Get information on which exchange your stock is traded on by going to the Investor Center of the company’s webpage. 3. Use the ticker symbol to obtain information on the stock. * Enter the ticker symbol in the search field of a financial services website, or use the stock-tracking tools provided by most major Internet browsers and search engines. * To find stock information in a newspaper, look for the ticker symbol under the appropriate exchange heading in the paper’s financial section. 4. Interpret the listed information for the stock. * The high, low and closing prices indicate how the stock performed in the previous trading day. They are the top, bottom and last price the stock traded at on that day. *	The greater the difference between those latter two prices, the greater the opportunity for gain or risk of loss with that stock. Conversely, a narrow price range without major swings suggests a more conservative investment.

Create a paste. The first step in using your powder facial cleanser is creating paste. This is done by mixing your powder cleanser with a bit of water. The exact measurements can vary from product to product, so read the instructions. A general rule is to begin with 1 tsp. of powder and 1 tsp. of water. This can be done in the palm of your hand. Continue adding water, little by little, until you have a smooth paste. * Avoid bringing the whole jar of powder cleanser into the shower with you. * This can allow moisture to get into the cleanser and ruin it. * Mix a fresh batch of cleansing paste each time you wash your face. 2. Secure your hair. Before cleansing your skin, be sure to secure your hair. This ensures that you can effectively cleanse your whole face without getting the product in your hair. This can be done with a shower cap, headband, or towel. 3. Massage the paste into your face and neck. Wet your face. Then apply the paste over your face and neck. Massage the paste in circular motions. Apply very gentle pressure as you do so. * Avoid the sensitive area around your eyes. 4.	Although warm water is best for cleansing, lukewarm or cool water is best to rinse. Warm water opens your pores and allows for a deep cleaning. Cool water, on the other hand, helps your pore to close again. Use cool water to rinse the paste from your face and neck. Repeat daily.

Style_Jogger_Pants.txt	### Choosing Your Jogger Pants	A solid pair with a different color or fabric cuff around the ankles creates a nice contrast .	### Choosing Your Jogger Pants	For example , a solid pair with a different color or fabric cuff around the ankles creates a nice contrast .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><A><1><a><4>	Choosing Your Jogger Pants  1. Decide what you want them for. In other words, determine if you want jogger pants for running errands and lounging, or if you’d like a pair you can dress up. The great thing about jogger pants is that there are plenty of styles that fall into both categories. If you prefer casual, comfy clothing, you can look for a pair of jogger pants similar to sweatpants. If you want to wear these to work or for dressier nights out, a pair of jogger pants in a nicer material and color might be the ticket. 2. Compare different materials. Seriously, there is no shortage of options when it comes to jogger pants. If you’re interested in rocking this style, familiarize yourself with all of the different fabrics and materials they come in! Depending on when and where you want to wear them, certain fabrics might be better. * If you’re going to wear them for lounging and running errands, stick to the traditional, knitted sweatpants material. These will feel like pajamas, but the tapered ankle and more fitted legs will make you look more pulled together. * If you want the ability to dress your jogger pants up, check out nicer versions in fabrics like tweed, corduroy, linen, and even leather. They’ll still be comfortable, but they’ll look much less like sweatpants! * Stick to lighter, airier pairs for warmer climates. A lightweight cotton or linen pair is perfect for this. * If you need some extra insulation, check out fleece-lined jogger pants or versions in heavier fabrics like wool. This is really a style that can be worn year-round! 3. Consider different colors and patterns. You can basically find jogger pants in every color and pattern under the sun. Again, it’s important to think about how you want to style them. A solid black pair can be easily dressed up, while a distressed gray pair may be a bit more limiting. A boldly patterned pair will make a statement, but they’ll be less versatile than a solid color. * Think about how a pair will fit into your current wardrobe. Ideally, you can find a pair that will look great with tops and shoes you already own! 4. Embrace the details. All jogger pants are not created equal. Simple pairs are great, but there are plenty of pairs with fun details and trendy features that will turn heads. Look for a pair with cool metallic zippers on the ankles, or a colorful drawstring around the waist.	.

Holding the folded sheet horizontally in front of you, first wrap one side around your chest and then the other side - like a towel. Leave 3-4 feet of one corner loose at the front of your body. 3. Make halter. Twist the 4 foot length a few times to make a sort of rope. Run this twisted sheet over your shoulder and behind your neck. Tie the end of the twist to the sheet running across your chest. 4. Adjust and secure. Spend some time smoothing the layers and folds. Then pin the toga onto your tube top. Take extra time to pin the halter securely. 5. (Optional) Add accessories.	.
Write_Gothic_Fiction.txt	### Making Your Gothic Fiction Unique	Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and Bram Stoker 's Dracula both use a found material framing devices by presenting the story through character letters and journal entries .	### Making Your Gothic Fiction Unique	For example , Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and Bram Stoker 's Dracula both use a found material framing devices by presenting the story through character letters and journal entries .	<insert><For><1>|||<insert><example><1>|||<insert><,><1>	Making Your Gothic Fiction Unique  1. Add a supernatural element. Gothic fiction often features something or someone supernatural. You can add a supernatural element to your story by making one of your characters a ghost, vampire, werewolf, or some other supernatural creature. Or, you could use your setting to create an eerie atmosphere that suggests something paranormal is at work. A spooky castle or house can add a supernatural element to your story. 2. Add children to your story. Children often feature into gothic fiction and they are usually in danger or in the care of less than capable guardians. For example, William Frankenstein (the younger brother of Victor Frankenstein) wanders off and is murdered by Frankenstein’s monster. Having children in your story who are placed in some sort of danger will infuse your story with extra tension throughout. Consider adding a child or even a few children to your story. 3. Add a prophecy or curse. Add intrigue to your story by including a prophecy that has something to do with the character or the setting (house, castle, etc.). The family in Horace Walpole’s Castle of Otranto is haunted by a prophecy that the castle will pass from Manfred’s line. Prophecies in gothic fiction are usually incomplete and confusing. A good prophecy should cause your readers to scratch their heads and want to know more. Sometimes gothic fiction stories feature a family curse or secret that haunts them. A curse can also help drive your hero’s actions and possibly even explain some if his or her behavior. 4. Add a damsel in distress. Gothic fiction stories often include a young woman who is in danger, like Matilda in Horace Walpole’s Castle of Otranto. Matilda is in love with one man, but she is lusted after by another, which puts her in danger throughout the book. This young woman may be your central character or your central character’s love interest. You can use this character as a way to influence the emotions of your readers, such as their pity, sadness, and fear. Depict your damsel’s reactions to her situation vividly by telling your readers how she feels, acts, and what she says. 5. Consider using a found material or true story framing device. Many gothic novels put forth the story that they tell as true or found in a diary. This way of framing the story adds an extra level of scariness, since it invites the reader imagine that the events of the story really transpired.	.

Introduce your story. In the beginning of your story, take care to fully describe your setting and characters who are present in the beginning of your story. Just make sure that you don’t give away too much information in the beginning. Leave some things to describe later, like the villain and other mysterious elements of your story. You can hint at these things early in your story, but don’t give in to the urge to share too much too soon. 2. Maintain an air of gloom and horror throughout your story. You can make sure that your story has a high level of creepiness by incorporating plenty of unnerving details. Taking care to describe the moon, the howling wind, or a dark corridor can help you to maintain an air of gloom and horror throughout your story. You can also describe the way that your characters are feeling or acting, as well as their facial expressions. 3. Maintain suspense and mystery throughout your story. Tantalize your readers by only offering them quick glimpses of your villain or a ghost, or by hinting at the family curse by holding off on fully explaining these things until later in the story. 4. Incorporate descriptions of heightened emotions throughout your story. Describing your characters emotional extremes can also contribute to the success of your gothic fiction. Incorporate over-the-top emotions like shrieking, cackling, fainting, and sobbing. These moments of hysteria will pull your readers into the story and help keep them entertained. 5. Incorporate themes of madness. Filtering descriptions of spooky occurrences through the mouth of a character who has gone mad will intrigue your readers and lead them to question what is actually happening. Therefore, the inclusion of a character who has gone mad will work on multiple levels: keeping your readers’ interest and making your story scarier.	.

The answer to this question will greatly affect the parts that you need to buy, so think about what you're goal is. 2. Next, once you know what you want, you need to organise parts. Generally, a turbo kit will consist of the turbocharger, manifolds, wastegates, downpipes, various oil/water lines, and various screws and bolts.	You will also need to consider your fuel system (injectors, pump and lines), your engine itself (whether it will need to be reinforced/built before the conversion), your cooling (front mount intercooler is a must, things such as an oil cooler, transmission cooler and oil catch can are optional), your suspension and tyres to ensure you can put the power to the ground, clutch, and also your ECU to control everything. As you can see, turbocharging a car is not a simple procedure and should only be carried out by professionals.

Get him/her alone. When you do this make sure your crush's friends aren't around. You wouldn't want them to spread rumors about your depression. If you have a crush on a teacher or another adult who has responsibilty for you, make sure that you talk to them in a way that's not going to make either of you uncomfortable. Remember this isn't something to be rushed either, you don't want to blurt out that you've been diagnosed with depression during a five minute break between classes, for example. 2. Make sure you can trust them and their intentions toward you. Ask them "Can I trust you?" or say "Promise you won't tell" make sure they give you your word that they won't tell, but, beware that they may feel obligated to tell anyone you are hiding your depression from. No one should have to go through depression alone or with only the help of someone you have a crush on. A decent person will want your parents to know, at least. 3. Give your crush the news. State the situation clearly so they understand. Don't tell them you have been feeling a bit down lately, or that you are sad.	You won't know how your crush will react to this. It depends on the person you have a crush on. If they try to help, let them. See what they say and do. Be prepared to say why you felt the need to tell them. Explain that your depression and the fact you have a crush on them are separate, or don't tell them them you have a crush on them at all of you prefer.

Seek medical attention if you experience severe symptoms. While the majority of scorpion stings are not harmful to adults, be aware of symptoms that indicate serious health risks. If any of the following describe the victim or his symptoms, seek medical attention before attempting to identify the scorpion: * Children, infants, the elderly, and people with a damaged heart or lung should always seek medical attention for a scorpion sting. * Vomiting, sweating, drooling, or foaming at the mouth * Involuntary urination or excretion (peeing or pooing) * Thrashing or twitching muscles, including involuntary head, neck, or eye movements, or difficulty walking * Accelerated or irregular heart rate * Difficulty breathing, swallowing, speaking, or seeing * Severe swelling from an allergic reaction 2. Capture the scorpion only if you can do so safely.	If you have a glass jar much larger than the scorpion (a quart or liter size is usually suitable), attempting to capture it will give an expert the greatest chance of identification. However, if you cannot see the scorpion, or do not have an appropriate container, do not attempt this step.

Choose your headset. * Most commercial headsets will do, but try to pick a pair that doesn't let sound bleed out of the speakers too badly. This can cause audio doubling, which is a severe annoyance. * If you can, pick one with a good, quality microphone. * Don't get cheated when you buy. Buy online where it is far cheaper to shop for electronics. There are plenty of budget headsets for people on a tight dime that are very high quality. * Turtle Beach and SADES are your best bet. Turtle Beach works for most consoles, and SADES is geared more towards PC gaming. 2. Know your surroundings. * Try to pick a nice, quiet place to play, where background audio won't be picked up by the microphone. Total elimination of background noise is impossible, but it should be reduced wherever possible. * Make sure the cords of your headset are unobstructed. You don't want your headset to be unplugged mid-chat. * If you must have music, please don't play it from a device in the background. Play it on your computer. Nobody wants to hear music filtered through your microphone. 3. Switch on voice chat. * Do a quick microphone check. The settings menu of your computer should be able to tell you how much sound your microphone is picking up. * On a Windows computer, type 'Manage Audio Devices' into the search bar, and you'll find it. * You may have to enable voice chat in the game. This will usually be found in the settings or options menu. * If the game has its own mic check, give it a quick try to see how you sound to other players. * If you think you sound good, go right on ahead. 4. Be polite and respectful. * Humans are possessed of a competitive spirit, but that's no excuse to fly off the handle. Watch your language when talking to the people around you. * A rule of thumb for ettiquite over the headset is this: if you wouldn't say it to their face, don't say it over a headset. * Specifically, however: Refrain from racial, ethnic, or homophobic slurs. * Depending on the game, think before you swear. If you're playing a T-Rated game, there might be sensitive ears playing. * For an M-Rated game, you have more leeway. * If you do swear, though, do not do so excessively. Nobody wants to play with the man who's screaming his face red and uses the F-word before every noun, subject, and verb. *	.

Carefully consider your audience. You need to consider who you are teaching and their skill levels. Are you teaching children, if so at what point are they on the developmental stages with literacy? Are you teaching adults, if so what are their comprehension and language skills like? 2. Create a lesson goal. What do you expect the students to be able to do by the time you have completed teaching? Should they be able to write in more than one format? Should they understand the basic framework of a letter? Without a goal to begin with it will be impossible to know if you have reached it at the end. 3. Plan the lesson/s. With a goal established it is now time to plan out the method you intend to use to teach this skill and ensure your students meet your goal. This is the step where you decide how many lessons are required and the time in those lessons that are needed to be spent on each aspect you intend to cover. 4. Play with creativity. Remember a lot of classes you have sat through in your life, when the teacher for the entire team just spoke at you, and you walked out learning nothing? Take these experiences and all the available literature on the different learning styles, such as visual, auditory and kinetic and use them to change the method of delivery and activities you intend to use in this lesson. 5. Introduce activities. Academia has spent time on researching kinetic learning as a valid style of learning. This requires a student to physically perform the task being taught in order to form the best memory pathways to remember it. With this in mind incorporate activities into your lesson that allow students to try writing a letter for themselves in different context.	The exact nature of the activities is a personal choice but incorporating it is important to cater for kinetic learners.

The salesperson will have information and will help you. * An aquarium is acceptable for a young chameleon, but you may want to buy a reptarium for better air circulation. A 4 month old chameleon may need a bigger enclosure. * If your chameleon seems to be choking on insects, give them smaller ones instead. * Chameleons have amazing camouflage- try not to lose your new pet in it's cage! * Put some fake vines in your enclosure. * They are hard to keep alive so be very careful about how you take care of them! * Feed your insects well with potatoes, cabbage, carrots, fish flake, low fat kitten chow, bee pollen, and potato flakes. Feed your insects well so you can feed your chameleon well. *	.

Survive_when_a_Parent_Threatens_Suicide.txt	## Steps	That is a serious threat , no matter how you cut it because Dad (A) has a plan ( a gun ) and (B) has the means ( the gun ) to carry out the threat .	## Steps	However , that is a serious threat , no matter how you cut it because Dad (A) has a plan ( a gun ) and (B) has the means ( the gun ) to carry out the threat .	<insert><However><1>|||<insert><,><1>|||<replace><That><1><that><3>	Steps  1. Understand that you are not a mental health professional. There are some situations that cannot be handled by family and/or friends, no matter how much you love your parent, no matter how well-intentioned you are. If your parent seems truly serious, repeats the threat more than once, or makes an attempt on his/her life, realize that you are out of your depth and will need to call in professional help (911 will do for starters). 2. Assess lethal intent. The first thing to do when a parent threatens suicide is to find out how serious the threat really is. Sometimes, this type of comment or remark is simply meant to tell you how much pain your parent is feeling, so that you understand how serious his or her pain really is. Other times, this is a deadly warning. You can try following these "sub steps" to figure out what you're dealing with: * Ask if s/he is truly thinking about hurting him/herself. It seems counter to good sense to come right out and ask, but do it. The most important thing you can do for your parent is to let him/her know that you hear the pain. Knowing that s/he is actually being heard and taken seriously can be Step 1 to recovery, believe it or not. So try not to just clobber your parent, but kindly and gently say something like, "Dad, it really hurts me to see you in such pain. When you said 'I feel like killing myself,' did you really mean that?" If Dad says, "I was just so frustrated..." that means you can probably exhale. It does not mean he won't feel worse later, but it does mean he wasn't serious. If Dad says, "I'm just tired of everything," that is much more serious. * Ask if s/he has a plan and/or the means to carry out the threat. Again, seems like something you should avoid asking, but nevertheless, this is not a time to get shy or nervous - a life is at stake. If Dad is 'tired of everything,' ask, "If you were going to really do it, would you know how you'd want to?" Again, you are trying to assess how lethal the intention here is. If Dad says, "I'd probably use my gun," you need to figure out where the gun is. If it's locked in a gun box or locker, it's not as serious as if it's in the nightstand drawer. However, if it's in the nightstand drawer, you could go and take it elsewhere.	On the other hand, if Dad responds with something like, "Oh, I don't know. Maybe pills? Something painless?" this is a less credible threat. He is vague on the details. You can press a little and ask what sort of pills. A response like, "Tylenol - lots of it. We have a huge bottle of them." is bad (he knows what pills he is thinking of, and has enough on hand). Something like, "Maybe I have enough sleeping pills and a couple of glasses of vodka...?" is not as bad (he's unsure if he has enough to do the job and which pills he's even thinking of).

Change the nipple flow. If you're using a 4, slowly work your way down to a 1. Eventually, use a nipple that has no hole in it. During this size reduction time period, make sure to make a sippy cup available to your child. When faced with a bottle that stops working and a functional sippy cup, the child will more than likely choose the cup. 2. Give the baby a sippy cup instead of a bottle during mealtime. Begin using the cup at one meal per day once the child is familiar with the cup. This may occur at 8-to-10 months old. 3. Let the child play with the cup first, even without liquid. This can begin as early as 3-6 months. Add increasingly larger amounts of milk as the child becomes familiar with the object. By giving the cup to your child early as a toy, you help the child become familiar with it. 4.	Do this until all meals are eaten with a sippy cup, instead of a bottle. Start with meals in the middle of the day and with snacks. Work on one feeding at a time. Don't rush, but also be sure to always make progress.

Wear dark colors such as black, red, blue and purple to get the attention of a Scorpio. Scorpios are drawn to colors that are dark or powerful. Go with any of these colors that compliments your eyes to really stand out to a Scorpio. 2. Court a Scorpio until you have earned their trust. What Scorpios truly desire is a meaningful and loving relationship. They long to connect on the deepest emotional, spiritual, and physical levels. This means it can take a long time for a Scorpio to fall in love. Scorpios are the most loyal people you will ever meet if they feel you are worthy of their loyalty and love. 3. Look for the light in their eyes. Making eye contact will tell you a lot about what a Scorpio is feeling even if they will not tell you. When a Scorpio loves you, it will shine in their eyes like a light. 4. If you want to win their heart, be honest at all times and don't play with their emotions. Scorpios have a desire to feel in control that won't tolerate emotional games.	.
Wear_a_Dress_to_School.txt	### Choosing the Right Dress	Would it be weird if you wore it to a fancy wedding ?	### Choosing the Right Dress	and would it be weird if you wore it to a fancy wedding ?	<insert><and><1>|||<replace><Would><1><would><2>	Choosing the Right Dress  1. Choose your stores wisely. The key to wearing a dress to school or college is to make sure you don’t look like you’re walking around ready for prom. Stay away from expensive formal stores, and instead look where you would normally shop for jeans and T-shirt’s. This is an easy way to find casual, comfy dresses for day to day wear. * Look online in stores you’d never expect. No matter what a store specializes in, they probably have at least one casual dress. 2. Pay attention to details. Certain details can really ensure that your dress is appropriate for day to day wear. Remember that you’ll be wearing this to school, so make sure that it fits your dress code comfortably. * Length- Shorter dresses are typically thought of as more casual. Although you can make certain longer dresses work, you would usually want to look for a dress that’s mid thigh or past your knees. However, keep in mind the activities you’ll be doing at school that a short dress may get in the way of, as well as dress code and wardrobe malfunction issues. A dress at least as long as your knees is a safer bet. * Pattern- Stay away from glitz and sparkle. Despite this looking a little fancier, this kind of glamour is a little loud for school. A plain colored dress, or one with a smaller floral pattern is a great place to start. * Fabric- Stiffer, more structured dresses can look very formal. Plus, they’re pretty uncomfortable to sit in, and you’ll be doing a lot of that at school. Opt for a more light and flowy fabric, especially for the skirt. * Neckline- Avoid high and deep v necklines if you can. A more casual neckline like you would see on a T-shirt gives you a more relaxed feel, as well as being more classroom appropriate. * Ruching in the back. Some casual dresses feature some non decorative ruching in the back panel of the dress. This is made out of an elastic material and is there to help the dress stretch to fit your body. This is a detail that generally only casual dresses have. 3. Specific styles. Some styles are sure to be a hit. * Wrap dresses- wrap dresses feature a wrap around the front that usually forms a v neck. Often they have a self tie around the waist or a hidden snap button or stitch to help keep the wrap panels together. Usually this style comes with super pretty short sleeves in a very light cotton fabric. This is an especially great style for school, because the sleeves lend it a comfy schoolgirl look. * Spaghetti strap dresses- dresses with very thin straps are a super cute choice. The extra detail of a straight or square neckline that often accompanies this style is very unique. Keep in mind the dress code for this one. If your school doesn’t allow it, you could try layering something under or over it, as described in the how to style portion. * Button down dresses- the height of casual cute! These dresses have a long row of non functional buttons going in a line from the neck to the hem. These come in a variety of different styles so you’re sure to find one you like. * Short sleeve dresses- you can’t go wrong with one of these. They come in so many different variations and are good for days when you want to be a little bit more conservative and cozy. They also cover the shoulders for those who have a stricter dress code. * Overall dresses- Simply a pair of overalls with a skirt instead of pants at the bottom. A great transition if you’re worried about wearing a dress to school. Usually worn with a T-shirt underneath, so you have lots of styling options. Because of the denim, this is a super cute and classic school outfit. * Tshirt dresses- another great way to make the change from not wearing dresses. Super comfortable as well as cute and offer a lot of styling options as well. Great for a day when you want to feel as comfy as possible. 4. If you ever aren’t sure if a dress is appropriate enough, try this easy trick. Can you wear it with sneakers or a denim jacket?	The answer to both questions should be yes. Also think about how comfortable you’ll be in the dress, and how easy it will be to sit, stand, walk, and run in, as well as how it fits into the dress code. If you’ve checked all theses boxes, you’re good to go!
Use_Parking_Lot_Etiquette.txt	## Steps	Even if one may have a tag for a disabled member of the family it should not be used if that person is not getting out of the car .	## Steps	but even if one may have a tag for a disabled member of the family it should not be used if that person is not getting out of the car .	<insert><but><1>|||<replace><Even><1><even><2>	Steps  1. Do not block other parking space seekers while you wait for a space to open up near the store entrance. The drivers in the cars behind you may be finished with their errands, and are ready to head for work or home. If the person is already pulling out, that's one thing. But if you're sitting there while they walk to the car, waiting while they put their bags in the car, etc. you'll be trying the patience of every other car behind you, especially if they can't go around you. 2. Never let small children push the shopping cart for you. Not only is it dangerous in busy parking lots, but a loaded shopping cart in a hilly parking lot can end up crashing into and damaging someone's vehicle. Children should also not be allowed to ride the cart back to the vehicle, with the exception of small toddlers or infants riding in the special seat built into many shopping carts, while a parent has both hands on the handle. 3. Center your vehicle in its parking space. Overhanging the stripes will tend to crowd the driver who parks in the adjacent space, and frequently leads to door dings in the paint of cars. 4. Pull your vehicle all the way into the space. This makes it easier for other drivers to see past your car when they are backing out of adjacent spaces, and also gives the widest possible driving lane between spaces. This can be particularly helpful when shoppers pushing loaded carts are sharing the driving lane with moving vehicles. 5. Never force your car into a space. In crowded, busy parking lots, special compact car spaces are becoming more common. Standard parking spaces are generally 9 feet wide, compact car spaces at 7 feet. Obviously, a large SUV or Pickup will not fit easily in a compact car space, and quite simply put, they are not supposed to. 6. Remove trailer hitch receivers if you are not towing a trailer. These receivers, usually made of heavy steel and often with sharp corners, can be dangerous to inattentive pedestrians trying to walk as close to parked vehicles as possible to give drivers more room. 7. Watch for drivers backing out of blind spots. Small cars parked between larger vehicles like vans and SUV often have to back blindly out of their spaces, so be alert and give them a break. If you are walking past a car in this situation, pause for a moment and guide the driver out of the tight spot if you are able. 8. Observe the legal aspects of driving in a parking lot. You are not likely to be pulled over by a State Police or Highway Patrolman, but there are laws regarding operating a motor vehicle in a public parking lot, just as there are on the highway. Here are some things to watch for. * Posted speed limits. Many large parking lots do have posted speed limits, these are for the safety of pedestrians and other drivers, please note and obey them. * One Way signs and markings. In parking lots with diagonal spaces, individual lanes may be one way, most often marked with a directional arrow painted on the pavement at the end of each lane. Even if the lane is not marked, you may be safe to assume the lane is one way if the diagonal spaces are oriented in the same direction on both sides. * Handicapped and elderly spaces. Handicapped parking spaces are generally clearly marked with signs and special striping, and are wider than regular spaces to accommodate wheel chairs. They are located near handicapped ramps, usually very close to the business's entrance. If you do not require the use of these spaces, and do not have a permit, park somewhere else. * Stop and Yield signs. These serve the same purpose in parking lots they serve on city streets, allowing the right-of-way to a vehicle driving in a certain lane or direction, and should be obeyed. * Pedestrian crosswalks. These are common near the main entrances and exits of most large businesses, for the safety of pedestrians returning to their cars. They are usually marked with diagonal white or yellow stripes, and often also are marked with a pedestrian crossing or stop sign. * Turn signals. Using turn signals gives other drivers an idea what your intentions are, use them in a timely manner to indicate what you are doing. 9. Keep the parking lot clean. Nobody likes to see trash blowing around the parking lot as they walk to and from the business, so stow the empty fast food wrappers, ash tray contents, drink bottles, and other potential debris until you have access to a waste receptacle. This should also apply to sales fliers and business literature, including that which is conveniently posted underneath windshield wiper blades while you are searching for your latest bargain. 10. Park shopping carts, dollies, and baskets in designated areas. Many large stores have cart corrals for shopping carts when the customer is finished unloading them. Putting the carts in these locations will make it less likely the cart you were using will end up denting someone else's car. 11. Leave the best spaces for less able visitors than yourself. Often, physically challenged people do not qualify for handicapped permits, or the handicapped spaces are full, meaning a person who may have difficulty making their way to the business has a long walk from their car. If you are healthy and willing, taking a further space may just help someone who really needs the close space (and give you a little exercise). 12. Keep children under control walking through parking lots. This will help protect them from inattentive drivers, and make the parking lot safer for everyone. 13. Avoid curb hopping. This is very important where landscaped areas are within the curb boundaries, since jumping the curb may damage plants and irrigation components. 14. Slow down in the rain. Driving at highway, or even street speeds in a parking lot filled with puddles of rain water can inundate a passing pedestrian, or even another driver who is traveling with their window down. 15. Resist temptation to blow the horn (or give the finger) to other drivers. You may feel like they were discourteous, but showing grace, rather than anger, shows more class and prevents reciprocal aggression. See How to Get Rid of Anger and How to Respond to a Road Raged Driver. 16. Park only in designated spaces. Parking along the curb, with the exception of loading zones, or for loading a heavy item or helping a less mobile individual with their load is annoying and often dangerous. 17. Use your turn signal. Signaling to others when reaching a desired parking spot will reduce unnecessary confusion in the parking lot. It is often thought that when two cars reach a parking spot at the same time from opposite directions, the one that turns their turn signal on first, claims the spot. 18. Never take a handicapped spot if no one getting out of the car is handicapped It's obvious that car's without a handicapped tag are not allowed to park in handicapped spots.	This would take up a spot for those who truly need it.
